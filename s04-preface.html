    <h3 class="title editable block">Preface</h3>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch00pref_p01">Knowing how to get along with others, resolve workplace conflict, manage relationships, communicate well, and make good decisions are all critical emotional intelligence skills students need to succeed in career and in life. Our <em class="emphasis">Human Relations</em> book will address all of the critical topics to obtain career success. This book isn’t an organizational behavior (OB) text, which is too theoretical for many of our students’ needs. While this book will focus on some of the theories you might find in an OB book, the focus is a direct benefit to students in their current and future jobs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch00pref_p02">This book also isn’t a professional communications, business English, or professionalism book, as the focus is much broader: it focuses on general career success and how to effectively maneuver in the workplace.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch00pref_p03">The core concept in the book is emotional intelligence and how these skills carry over into career success, such as through ethics, communication, diversity, teamwork, conflict, good decision making, stress management, motivation, and leadership.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch00pref_p04">This book’s easy-to-understand language and tone is written to convey practical information in an engaging way. Plenty of examples are included in each chapter so students understand the concepts and how the concepts can benefit their career. This book will meet the needs of a course in the business department or will be offered to professional technical students in any number of career fields, such as automotive, dental hygiene, culinary, or technology. In addition, this book would be a great addition to any school offering human relations course for teacher certification.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch00pref_p05">This book could be used in the following courses:</p>
