        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Human Relations?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">So, what is human relations? We can define <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">human relations</a><span class="glossdef">Relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace or professional setting.</span></span> as relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace or professional setting.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_001">Merriam Webster Dictionary, accessed January 30, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/human%20relations">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/human%20relations</a></span> From a personal perspective, there are many advantages to having good human relations skills. First, of the top ten reasons people are fired, several reasons relate back to lack of human relations skills—for example, the inability to work within a team, personality issues, sexual harassment, and dishonesty.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_002">Natalie Jones, “10 Most Common Reasons Why People Are Fired,” Wikinut article, February 28, 2010, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business.wikinut.com/10-Most-Common-Reasons-People-are-Fired/ggcsrftv/">http://business.wikinut.com/10-Most-Common-Reasons-People-are-Fired/ggcsrftv/</a></span> Other reasons, perhaps not directly related to human relations, include absenteeism, poor performance, stealing, political reasons, downsizing, and sabotage. Second, people who are competent team players and have a good work ethic tend to get promoted faster.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_003">Jean Maye, “7 Steps to Getting Promoted,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Tribune</em>, 2012, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/sns-jobs-steps-promotion,0,6989913.story">http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/sns-jobs-steps-promotion,0,6989913.story</a></span> In fact, according to guru on personal development Brian Tracy, 85 percent of your success in life is determined by social skills and the ability to interact positively and effectively with others.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_004">Brian Tracy, “Mastering Human Relationships,” Brian Tracy International, August 19, 2009, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/mastering-human-relationships/">http://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/mastering-human-relationships/</a></span> Another reason to develop good relationships with others relates to your own personal happiness.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">Consider John, a very talented project manager but lacking in human relations skills. While he is easily able to plan and execute the finest details for a project, no one likes to work with him. He doesn’t make efforts to get to know his team members and he comes across as unfriendly and unapproachable. How successful do you think John will be in his workplace? While he has the skills necessary to do the job, he doesn’t have the people skills that can help him excel at it. One could say he does not have emotional intelligence skills—that is, the ability to understand others—therefore, he may always find himself wondering why he isn’t more successful at work (we will discuss emotional intelligence in <a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Achieve Personal Success"</a>). While project management skills are something we can learn, managers find it difficult to hire people without the soft skills, or human relations skills. We aren’t saying that skills are not important, but human relations skills are equally as important as technical skills to determine career and personal success. Consider human relations skills in your personal life, as this is equally important. Human relations skills such as communication and handling conflict can help us create better relationships. For example, assume Julie talks behind people’s backs and doesn’t follow through on her promises. She exhibits body language that says “get away from me” and rarely smiles or asks people about themselves. It is likely that Julie will have very few, if any, friends. If Julie had positive human relations skills, there is a much better chance she could improve her personal relationships.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">We can benefit personally and professionally from good human relations skills, but how do organizations benefit? Since many companies’ organizational structures depend upon people working together, positive human relations skills reduce conflict in the workplace, thereby making the workplace more productive. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organizational structures</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to the way a company arranges people, jobs, and communications so that work can be performed.</span></span> refer to the way a company arranges people, jobs, and communications so that work can be performed. In today’s business world, teams are used to accomplish company goals because teamwork includes people with a variety of skills. When using those skills in a team, a better product and better ideas are usually produced. In most businesses, to be successful at our job, we need to depend on others. The importance of human relations is apparent in this setting. If people are not able to get along and resolve conflicts, the organization as a whole will be less productive, which could affect profitability. Many organizations <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">empower</a><span class="glossdef">When an organization gives the employees freedom in making decisions about how their work gets done.</span></span> their employees; that is, they give employees freedom in making decisions about how their work gets done. This can create a more motivated workforce, which results in more positive human relations. We will explore this topic further in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch07#portolesedias_1.0-ch07">Chapter 6 "Understand Your Motivations"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p04">Most organizations employ a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">total person approach</a><span class="glossdef">This approach recognizes that an organization employs not just someone with skills but rather the whole person.</span></span>. This approach recognizes that an organization does not just employ someone with skills, but rather, the whole person. This person comes with biases, personal challenges, human relations skills, and technical skills but also comes with experiences. By looking at a person from this perspective, an organization can begin to understand that what happens to an employee outside of work can affect his or her job performance. For example, assume Kathy is doing a great job at work but suddenly starts to arrive late, leave early, and take longer lunches. Upon further examination, we might find that Kathy is having childcare issues because of her divorce. Because of a total person approach perspective, her organization might be able to rearrange her schedule or work with her to find a reasonable solution. This relates to human relations because we are not just people going to work every day; we are people who live our personal lives, and one affects the other. Because of this, our human relations abilities will most certainly be affected if we are experiencing challenges at home or at work.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Evolution of Human Relations Study</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">Human relations, however, was not always central to the conversation on organizational success. In fact, until the 1940s, little thought was given to the human aspect of jobs. Many of the jobs in the early 1900s were focused on production and located in factory-like settings where the jobs themselves were repetitive. The focus in these types of work environments was on efficiency. We can call this time period of human relations studies the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">classical school of management</a><span class="glossdef">A time period relating to the research of human relations that focused on efficiency. The time period for this school of thought took place from 1900 to the early 1920s.</span></span>. This school of thought took place from 1900 to the early 1920s. Several theories were developed, which revolved around the idea of efficiency, or getting a job done with the least amount of steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Frederick W. Taylor was an engineer who today is known as the father of scientific management. He began his career in a steel company and, because of his intimate knowledge of the industry, believed that organizations could analyze tasks to make them performed with more efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">Following his work, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth performed numerous studies on physical motions workers took to perform specific tasks and tried to maximize efficiency by suggesting new ways to perform the tasks, using less energy and thereby being more efficient.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p04">While Taylor and Gilbreth’s research was more focused on physical motions and tasks, Henri Fayol began looking at how management could improve productivity instead of focusing on specific tasks and motions. Fayol created the Fourteen Principles of Management, which focused on management but also hinted to the importance of human relations:<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_007">Girish Sharmaa, “Henri Fayol’s Principles of Management,” Publish Your Articles, no date, accessed February 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.publishyourarticles.org/knowledge-hub/business-studies/henry-fayols-principles-of-management.html">http://www.publishyourarticles.org/knowledge-hub/business-studies/henry-fayols-principles-of-management.html</a></span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Division of work.</strong> Work should be divided in the most efficient way. Fayol believed work specialization, or the focus on specific tasks for teams or individuals, to be crucial to success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Authority.</strong> Authority is the right to give orders and accountability within those orders. Fayol believed that along with giving orders and expecting them to be met, that person in authority also assumes responsibility to make sure tasks are met.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discipline.</strong> Discipline is penalties applied to encourage common effort, as a successful organization requires the common effort of all workers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unity of command.</strong> Workers should receive orders from only one manager. In other words, reporting to two or more managers would violate Fayol’s Fourteen Principles of Management.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unity of direction.</strong> Everyone in the organization should move toward a common goal and understand how the team will achieve that goal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Subordination of individual interests to general interests.</strong> The interests of one person shouldn’t have priority over the interests of the organization as a whole. This focuses on teamwork and the importance of everyone acting toward the same goal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Remuneration.</strong> Many things should be considered when paying employees, including cost of living, supply of qualified people, and business success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Centralization.</strong> The degree of importance in the subordinates’ (employees’) role in their organization and the amount of decision making that occurs at a central level versus a decentralized level. For example, in many organizations decisions are made centrally (i.e., in the “corporate office”), which does not allow as much flexibility as decentralized decision making; this would mean each individual area can make its own decisions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Scalar chain.</strong> This refers to how authority is divided among managers. Specifically, Fayol said lower-level managers should always keep upper-level managers informed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Order.</strong> All materials and people related to one kind of work should be organized and neat. Things should be easy to find.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Equity.</strong> All employees should be treated equally.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stability of tenure of personnel.</strong> Retention of employees should be a high management priority. The cost of hiring a new worker is expensive, so efforts should be maintained to keep current employees.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Initiative.</strong> Management should take steps to encourage workers to take initiative. In addition, workers should be self-directed and not need a lot of management control to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Esprit de corps.</strong> Managers should encourage harmony among employees. This harmony creates good feelings among employees.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p05">Fayol’s research was some of the first that addressed the need for positive human relations in a work environment. As further research was performed into the 1920s, we moved into a new period of human relations studies called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral school of management</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1920s when employees had begun to unionize, researchers began to look at the human aspect of workers.</span></span>. During this time period, employees had begun to unionize, bringing human relations issues to the forefront. Because workers demanded a more humane environment, researchers began to look at how organizations could make this happen.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p06">One of the more notable researchers was Elton Mayo, from Harvard Business School, and his colleagues. They conducted a series of experiments from the mid-1920s to early 1930s to investigate how physical working conditions affected worker productivity. They found that regardless of changes such as heat, lighting, hours, and breaks, productivity levels increased during the study. The researchers realized the increased productivity resulted because the workers knew they were being observed. In other words, the workers worked harder because they were receiving attention and felt cared about. This phenomenon is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hawthorne effect</a><span class="glossdef">Coined during the 1920s during a series of experiments where workers had higher productivity because they were being watched by researchers and felt cared about.</span></span> (named for the electrical plant for which the experiments were conducted).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p07">In the 1950s, researchers began to explore management techniques and the effect on worker satisfaction. This was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral science approach</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1950s when researchers began to explore management techniques as opposed to earlier years where the focus was more on productivity.</span></span>. These techniques used psychology, sociology, and other human relations aspects to help researchers understand the organizational environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p08">Since the 1960s, research on human relations has been much easier to assimilate because of technology and a focus on statistical analysis. Hence, this is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management science school</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1960s when the research on human relations was more focused on statistical aspects, due to the increase in technology.</span></span>. So while research today focuses on the human relations aspect, we are now able to use complex statistical models to improve efficiency and productivity while still focusing on the human relations component.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Human Relations, Technology, and Globalization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p01">While we discuss the impact of technology on human relations throughout the book, it is important to mention here the immense impact technology has had on this field of study. Inability to see body language indicators make it more difficult to communicate using technology, creating conflict and misunderstandings. These misunderstandings can obviously affect human relations. Also consider that through globalization, we are working with people from all over the world in many time zones who have different perspectives. Between technology and globalization, humans have never had to work with such a diverse group of people—using diverse methods of communication—at any time in history.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Technology has allowed us to do this: e-mail, Skype, and instant message, to name a few. The impact on human relations is obvious—there is less face-to-face interactions and more interactions using technology. Add in the challenge of a global environment and this creates a whole new set of challenges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p03">Many organizations today are focusing on how to use technology to save workers time commuting to work.

<em class="emphasis">Human relations</em> is an important part to our career success. It is defined as relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace setting. Because a company depends on good human relations through its organizational structure, developing these skills is important.</li>
                <li>Technology has greatly impacted human relations because so much of our communication occurs without the advantage of seeing body language. This can result in miscommunications. Many workers <em class="emphasis">telecommute</em> to work. There are advantages and disadvantages, more notably a disadvantage being the lack of human, face-to-face contact.</li>
                <li>There was an evolution in human relations study. In the <em class="emphasis">classical school of management</em>, the focus was on efficiency and not on human relations.</li>
                <li>Employees began to unionize in the 1920s due to lack of positive human relations, and therefore the <em class="emphasis">behavioral school of management</em> was created. During this time period, researchers began to focus on the human relations aspect of the workplace. One of the major theories developed was the <em class="emphasis">Hawthorne effect</em>, which determined that workers were more productive when they were being watched and cared about by researchers.</li>
                <li>During the 1950s, the <em class="emphasis">behavioral science approach</em> looked at management techniques as a way to increase productivity and human relations.</li>
                <li>In the 1960s and beyond, sophisticated tools allow researchers to analyze more data and focus on the statistical aspects of human relations and management data.</li>
