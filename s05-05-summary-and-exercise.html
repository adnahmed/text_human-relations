            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Human relations</em> is an important part to our career success. It is defined as relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace setting. Because a company depends on good human relations through its organizational structure, developing these skills is important.</li>
            <li>Technology has greatly impacted human relations because so much of our communication occurs without the advantage of seeing body language. This can result in miscommunications. Many workers <em class="emphasis">telecommute</em> to work. There are advantages and disadvantages, a more notable disadvantage being the lack of human, face-to-face contact.</li>
            <li>There was an evolution in human relations study. In the <em class="emphasis">classical school of management</em>, the focus was on efficiency and not on human relations.</li>
            <li>Employees began to unionize in the 1920s due to lack of positive human relations, and therefore the <em class="emphasis">behavioral school of management</em> was created. During this time period, researchers began to focus on the human relations aspect of the workplace. One of the major theories developed was the <em class="emphasis">Hawthorne effect</em>, which determined that workers were more productive when they were being watched and cared about by researchers.</li>
            <li>During the 1950s, the <em class="emphasis">behavioral science approach</em> looked at management techniques as a way to increase productivity and human relations.</li>
            <li>In the 1960s and beyond, sophisticated tools allow researchers to analyze more data and focus on the statistical aspects of human relations and management data.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Personality</em> is defined as a stable set of traits that can explain or predict a person’s behavior in a variety of situations. Our personality affects the way we interact with others. Our personality comes from both environmental factors and some factors we are just born with (nature).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Values</em> are the things we find important to us. If our values conflict with another’s, there may be a miscommunication or other issues.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Attitudes</em> can be favorable or unfavorable feelings toward people, things, or situations. Our attitudes have a great impact on each other. If one person has a bad attitude, it is likely to be contagious. We can do many things to change our attitude, but all include making a conscious effort to be aware of our negative thoughts and feelings.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Perception</em> refers to how we interpret stimuli such as people, things, or events. Our perception is important to recognize because it is the driving force behind our reaction to things.</li>
            <li>Heredity, needs, peer group, interests, and expectations all influence our perception. A <em class="emphasis">halo effect</em> or <em class="emphasis">reverse halo effect</em> can also influence our perception.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-esteem</em> is defined as the opinion one has about their value as a person. This is different than <em class="emphasis">self-confidence</em>, which refers to the belief someone has in themselves. Both are important determinants to career and human relations success.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-efficacy</em> is the confidence someone has to carry out a specific task. Self-confidence and self-efficacy can come from a variety of sources.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-image</em> is how you think others view you, while <em class="emphasis">projection</em> refers to how your self-esteem is reflected in others.</li>
            <li>The <em class="emphasis">Johari window</em> is a tool to look at our own self-esteem and learn how others view us. The Johari window involves the <em class="emphasis">open area</em>, <em class="emphasis">hidden area</em>, <em class="emphasis">blind area</em>, and <em class="emphasis">unknown area</em>.</li>
