    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s01_p01">Jenny is going to a BBQ at Monica and Harvey’s house this afternoon. Because it is a big annual event, it is usually a large party. She will likely know about half the people, as Monica and Harvey invite people from all aspects of their lives. As Jenny enters the backyard, she sees familiar faces, as expected, but also sees a lot of people she doesn’t recognize. Immediately she starts fidgeting, as Jenny isn’t good at making small talk. Instead of making eye contact and going over to people who are acquaintances, she drops her potluck dish down, grabs a drink from the cooler, and tries to find Monica so she will have someone to talk with.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">At work, Jenny avoids interpersonal relationships and small talk because she is uncomfortable revealing too much of herself. When Jenny attends meetings at work, she sighs impatiently when someone is late and when people veer too far from the topic, and she makes sure to bring people back to reality. When choosing project teams, people rarely want to work with Jenny, even though she is very capable in her job. Some of the women from the office get together for lunch on Tuesdays, but Jenny is never invited. Needless to say, Jenny isn’t well liked at work.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s01_p03">We have all met someone like Jenny, who is seemingly uncomfortable with herself and unpleasant. We may even try to avoid the Jennys we know. Despite Jenny being good at her job, no one wants to work with her. You would think that success at work only takes talent at job-specific tasks. However, this isn’t the case. As we will discuss throughout this chapter and the book, successful people have the skills to do the job, but they also have the human relations skills to get along with others. The focus of this chapter will be personality, attitudes, self-esteem, and perceptions—all of these topics and more impact our ability to get along with others.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p01">So, what is human relations?

First, of the top ten reasons people are fired, several reasons relate back to lack of human relations skills—for example, the inability to work within a team, personality issues, sexual harassment, and dishonesty.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_002">Natalie Jones, “10 Most Common Reasons Why People Are Fired,” Wikinut article, February 28, 2010, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business.wikinut.com/10-Most-Common-Reasons-People-are-Fired/ggcsrftv/">http://business.wikinut.com/10-Most-Common-Reasons-People-are-Fired/ggcsrftv/</a></span> Other reasons, perhaps not directly related to human relations, include absenteeism, poor performance, stealing, political reasons, downsizing, and sabotage. Second, people who are competent team players and have a good work ethic tend to get promoted faster.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_003">Jean Maye, “7 Steps to Getting Promoted,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Tribune</em>, 2012, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/sns-jobs-steps-promotion,0,6989913.story">http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/jobs/sns-jobs-steps-promotion,0,6989913.story</a></span> In fact, according to guru on personal development Brian Tracy, 85 percent of your success in life is determined by social skills and the ability to interact positively and effectively with others.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_004">Brian Tracy, “Mastering Human Relationships,” Brian Tracy International, August 19, 2009, accessed January 31, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/mastering-human-relationships/">http://www.briantracy.com/blog/personal-success/mastering-human-relationships/</a></span> Another reason to develop good relationships with others relates to your own personal happiness.

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p02">Consider John, a very talented project manager but lacking in human relations skills. While he is easily able to plan and execute the finest details for a project, no one likes to work with him. He doesn’t make efforts to get to know his team members and he comes across as unfriendly and unapproachable. How successful do you think John will be in his workplace? While he has the skills necessary to do the job, he doesn’t have the people skills that can help him excel at it. One could say he does not have emotional intelligence skills—that is, the ability to understand others—therefore, he may always find himself wondering why he isn’t more successful at work (we will discuss emotional intelligence in <a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Achieve Personal Success"</a>). While project management skills are something we can learn, managers find it difficult to hire people without the soft skills, or human relations skills. We aren’t saying that skills are not important, but human relations skills are equally as important as technical skills to determine career and personal success. Consider human relations skills in your personal life, as this is equally important. Human relations skills such as communication and handling conflict can help us create better relationships. For example, assume Julie talks behind people’s backs and doesn’t follow through on her promises. She exhibits body language that says “get away from me” and rarely smiles or asks people about themselves. It is likely that Julie will have very few, if any, friends. If Julie had positive human relations skills, there is a much better chance she could improve her personal relationships.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p03">We can benefit personally and professionally from good human relations skills, but how do organizations benefit? Since many companies’ organizational structures depend upon people working together, positive human relations skills reduce conflict in the workplace, thereby making the workplace more productive. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organizational structures</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to the way a company arranges people, jobs, and communications so that work can be performed.</span></span> refer to the way a company arranges people, jobs, and communications so that work can be performed. In today’s business world, teams are used to accomplish company goals because teamwork includes people with a variety of skills. When using those skills in a team, a better product and better ideas are usually produced. In most businesses, to be successful at our job, we need to depend on others. The importance of human relations is apparent in this setting. If people are not able to get along and resolve conflicts, the organization as a whole will be less productive, which could affect profitability. Many organizations <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">empower</a><span class="glossdef">When an organization gives the employees freedom in making decisions about how their work gets done.</span></span> their employees; that is, they give employees freedom in making decisions about how their work gets done. This can create a more motivated workforce, which results in more positive human relations. We will explore this topic further in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch07#portolesedias_1.0-ch07">Chapter 6 "Understand Your Motivations"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s01_p04">Most organizations employ a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">total person approach</a><span class="glossdef">This approach recognizes that an organization employs not just someone with skills but rather the whole person.</span></span>. This approach recognizes that an organization does not just employ someone with skills, but rather, the whole person. This person comes with biases, personal challenges, human relations skills, and technical skills but also comes with experiences. By looking at a person from this perspective, an organization can begin to understand that what happens to an employee outside of work can affect his or her job performance. For example, assume Kathy is doing a great job at work but suddenly starts to arrive late, leave early, and take longer lunches. Upon further examination, we might find that Kathy is having childcare issues because of her divorce. Because of a total person approach perspective, her organization might be able to rearrange her schedule or work with her to find a reasonable solution. This relates to human relations because we are not just people going to work every day; we are people who live our personal lives, and one affects the other. Because of this, our human relations abilities will most certainly be affected if we are experiencing challenges at home or at work.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Evolution of Human Relations Study</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">Human relations, however, was not always central to the conversation on organizational success. In fact, until the 1940s, little thought was given to the human aspect of jobs. Many of the jobs in the early 1900s were focused on production and located in factory-like settings where the jobs themselves were repetitive. The focus in these types of work environments was on efficiency. We can call this time period of human relations studies the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">classical school of management</a><span class="glossdef">A time period relating to the research of human relations that focused on efficiency. The time period for this school of thought took place from 1900 to the early 1920s.</span></span>. This school of thought took place from 1900 to the early 1920s. Several theories were developed, which revolved around the idea of efficiency, or getting a job done with the least amount of steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">Frederick W. Taylor was an engineer who today is known as the father of scientific management. He began his career in a steel company and, because of his intimate knowledge of the industry, believed that organizations could analyze tasks to make them performed with more efficiency.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">Following his work, Frank and Lillian Gilbreth performed numerous studies on physical motions workers took to perform specific tasks and tried to maximize efficiency by suggesting new ways to perform the tasks, using less energy and thereby being more efficient.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p04">While Taylor and Gilbreth’s research was more focused on physical motions and tasks, Henri Fayol began looking at how management could improve productivity instead of focusing on specific tasks and motions. Fayol created the Fourteen Principles of Management, which focused on management but also hinted to the importance of human relations:<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_007">Girish Sharmaa, “Henri Fayol’s Principles of Management,” Publish Your Articles, no date, accessed February 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.publishyourarticles.org/knowledge-hub/business-studies/henry-fayols-principles-of-management.html">http://www.publishyourarticles.org/knowledge-hub/business-studies/henry-fayols-principles-of-management.html</a></span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Division of work.</strong> Work should be divided in the most efficient way. Fayol believed work specialization, or the focus on specific tasks for teams or individuals, to be crucial to success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Authority.</strong> Authority is the right to give orders and accountability within those orders. Fayol believed that along with giving orders and expecting them to be met, that person in authority also assumes responsibility to make sure tasks are met.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discipline.</strong> Discipline is penalties applied to encourage common effort, as a successful organization requires the common effort of all workers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unity of command.</strong> Workers should receive orders from only one manager. In other words, reporting to two or more managers would violate Fayol’s Fourteen Principles of Management.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unity of direction.</strong> Everyone in the organization should move toward a common goal and understand how the team will achieve that goal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Subordination of individual interests to general interests.</strong> The interests of one person shouldn’t have priority over the interests of the organization as a whole. This focuses on teamwork and the importance of everyone acting toward the same goal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Remuneration.</strong> Many things should be considered when paying employees, including cost of living, supply of qualified people, and business success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Centralization.</strong> The degree of importance in the subordinates’ (employees’) role in their organization and the amount of decision making that occurs at a central level versus a decentralized level. For example, in many organizations decisions are made centrally (i.e., in the “corporate office”), which does not allow as much flexibility as decentralized decision making; this would mean each individual area can make its own decisions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Scalar chain.</strong> This refers to how authority is divided among managers. Specifically, Fayol said lower-level managers should always keep upper-level managers informed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Order.</strong> All materials and people related to one kind of work should be organized and neat. Things should be easy to find.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Equity.</strong> All employees should be treated equally.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stability of tenure of personnel.</strong> Retention of employees should be a high management priority. The cost of hiring a new worker is expensive, so efforts should be maintained to keep current employees.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Initiative.</strong> Management should take steps to encourage workers to take initiative. In addition, workers should be self-directed and not need a lot of management control to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Esprit de corps.</strong> Managers should encourage harmony among employees. This harmony creates good feelings among employees.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p05">Fayol’s research was some of the first that addressed the need for positive human relations in a work environment. As further research was performed into the 1920s, we moved into a new period of human relations studies called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral school of management</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1920s when employees had begun to unionize, researchers began to look at the human aspect of workers.</span></span>. During this time period, employees had begun to unionize, bringing human relations issues to the forefront. Because workers demanded a more humane environment, researchers began to look at how organizations could make this happen.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p06">One of the more notable researchers was Elton Mayo, from Harvard Business School, and his colleagues. They conducted a series of experiments from the mid-1920s to early 1930s to investigate how physical working conditions affected worker productivity. They found that regardless of changes such as heat, lighting, hours, and breaks, productivity levels increased during the study. The researchers realized the increased productivity resulted because the workers knew they were being observed. In other words, the workers worked harder because they were receiving attention and felt cared about. This phenomenon is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hawthorne effect</a><span class="glossdef">Coined during the 1920s during a series of experiments where workers had higher productivity because they were being watched by researchers and felt cared about.</span></span> (named for the electrical plant for which the experiments were conducted).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p07">In the 1950s, researchers began to explore management techniques and the effect on worker satisfaction. This was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral science approach</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1950s when researchers began to explore management techniques as opposed to earlier years where the focus was more on productivity.</span></span>. These techniques used psychology, sociology, and other human relations aspects to help researchers understand the organizational environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p08">Since the 1960s, research on human relations has been much easier to assimilate because of technology and a focus on statistical analysis. Hence, this is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management science school</a><span class="glossdef">During the 1960s when the research on human relations was more focused on statistical aspects, due to the increase in technology.</span></span>. So while research today focuses on the human relations aspect, we are now able to use complex statistical models to improve efficiency and productivity while still focusing on the human relations component.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Human Relations, Technology, and Globalization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p01">While we discuss the impact of technology on human relations throughout the book, it is important to mention here the immense impact technology has had on this field of study. Inability to see body language indicators make it more difficult to communicate using technology, creating conflict and misunderstandings. These misunderstandings can obviously affect human relations. Also consider that through globalization, we are working with people from all over the world in many time zones who have different perspectives. Between technology and globalization, humans have never had to work with such a diverse group of people—using diverse methods of communication—at any time in history.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Technology has allowed us to do this: e-mail, Skype, and instant message, to name a few. The impact on human relations is obvious—there is less face-to-face interactions and more interactions using technology. Add in the challenge of a global environment and this creates a whole new set of challenges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p03">Many organizations today are focusing on how to use technology to save workers time commuting to work.

<em class="emphasis">Human relations</em> is an important part to our career success. It is defined as relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace setting. Because a company depends on good human relations through its organizational structure, developing these skills is important.</li>
                <li>Technology has greatly impacted human relations because so much of our communication occurs without the advantage of seeing body language. This can result in miscommunications. Many workers <em class="emphasis">telecommute</em> to work. There are advantages and disadvantages, more notably a disadvantage being the lack of human, face-to-face contact.</li>
                <li>There was an evolution in human relations study. In the <em class="emphasis">classical school of management</em>, the focus was on efficiency and not on human relations.</li>
                <li>Employees began to unionize in the 1920s due to lack of positive human relations, and therefore the <em class="emphasis">behavioral school of management</em> was created. During this time period, researchers began to focus on the human relations aspect of the workplace. One of the major theories developed was the <em class="emphasis">Hawthorne effect</em>, which determined that workers were more productive when they were being watched and cared about by researchers.</li>
                <li>During the 1950s, the <em class="emphasis">behavioral science approach</em> looked at management techniques as a way to increase productivity and human relations.</li>
                <li>In the 1960s and beyond, sophisticated tools allow researchers to analyze more data and focus on the statistical aspects of human relations and management data.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Determines Our Personality?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personality</a><span class="glossdef">A set of traits that can explain or predict a person’s behavior in variety of situations.</span></span> is defined as a set of traits that can explain or predict a person’s behavior in a variety of situations. In other words, personality is a set of characteristics that reflect the way we think and act in a given situation. Because of this, our personality has a lot to do with how we relate to one another at work. How we think, what we feel, and our normal behavior characterize what our colleagues come to expect of us both in behavior and the expectation of their interactions with us. For example, let’s suppose at work you are known for being on time but suddenly start showing up late daily. This directly conflicts with your personality—that is, the fact that you are conscientious. As a result, coworkers might start to believe something is wrong. On the other hand, if you did not have this characteristic, it might not be as surprising or noteworthy. Likewise, if your normally even-tempered supervisor yells at you for something minor, you may believe there is something more to his or her anger since this isn’t a normal personality trait and also may have a more difficult time handling the situation since you didn’t expect it. When we come to expect someone to act a certain way, we learn to interact with them based on their personality. This goes both ways, and people learn to interact with us based on our personality. When we behave different than our normal personality traits, people may take time to adjust to the situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p02">Personality also affects our ability to interact with others, which can impact our career success. In a 2009 study<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_010">Angelina R. Sutin and Paul T. Costa, “Personality and Career Success,” <em class="emphasis">European Journal of Personality</em> 23, no. 2 (March 2009): 71–84.</span> by Angelina Sutin et al., it was found that the personality characteristic of neuroticism (a tendency to experience negative emotional states) had more effect than any personality characteristic on determining future career success. In other words, those with positive and hopeful personalities tend to be rewarded through career success later in life.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p03">Although there is debate between whether or not our personalities are inherent when we are born (nature) versus the way we grew up (nurture), most researchers agree that personality is usually a result of both nature and our environmental/education experiences. For example, you have probably heard someone say, “She acts just like her mother.” She likely behaves that way because she was born with some of her mother’s traits, as well as because she learned some of the behaviors her mother passed to her while growing up.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p04">Another example might be someone who grows up with their parents constantly having parties. As a result, as an adult this person may end up organizing a lot of parties, too. Or the influence of parties may create the opposite effect, where the person doesn’t want to have parties at all. The environmental and educational experiences can create positive or negative associations, which result in how we feel about any situation that occurs in our lives.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_011">Alexandria Lupu, “Our Personality: Is It Genetically Inherited or Determined by the Environmental Factors,” Softpedia News, July 2, 2006, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Our-Personality-Is-It-Genetically-Inherited-or-Determined-by-The-Environmental-Factors-28413.shtml">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Our-Personality-Is-It-Genetically-Inherited-or-Determined-by-The-Environmental- Factors-28413.shtml</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p05">Our values help determine our personality. Our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">values</a><span class="glossdef">The things we find most important to us.</span></span> are those things we find most important to us. For example, if your value is calmness and peace, your personality would show this in many possible ways. You might prefer to have a few close friends and avoid going to a nightclub on Saturday nights. You might choose a less stressful career path, and you might find it challenging to work in a place where frequent conflict occurs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p06">We often find ourselves in situations where our values do not coincide with someone we are working with. For example, if Alison’s main value is connection, this may come out in a warm communication style with coworkers and an interest in their personal lives. Imagine Alison works with Tyler, whose core value is efficiency. Because of Tyler’s focus, he may find it a waste of time to make small talk with colleagues. When Alison approaches Tyler and asks about his weekend, she may feel offended or upset when he brushes her off to ask about the project they are working on together. She feels like a connection wasn’t made, and he feels like she isn’t efficient. Understanding our own values as well as the values of others can greatly help us become better communicators.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What about Our Attitudes?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p01">Our <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attitudes</a><span class="glossdef">Favorable or unfavorable feelings toward people, things, or situations.</span></span> are favorable or unfavorable opinions toward people, things, or situations. Many things affect our attitudes, including the environment we were brought up in and our individual experiences. Our personalities and values play a large role in our attitudes as well. For example, many people may have attitudes toward politics that are similar to their parents, but their attitudes may change as they gain more experiences. If someone has a bad experience around the ocean, they may develop a negative attitude around beach activities. However, assume that person has a memorable experience seeing sea lions at the beach, for example, then he or she may change their opinion about the ocean. Likewise, someone may have loved the ocean, but if they have a scary experience, such as nearly drowning, they may change their attitude.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02">The important thing to remember about attitudes is that they can change over time, but usually some sort of positive experience needs to occur for our attitudes to change dramatically for the better. We also have control of our attitude in our thoughts. If we constantly stream negative thoughts, it is likely we may become a negative person.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p03">In a workplace environment, you can see where attitude is important. Someone’s personality may be cheerful and upbeat. These are the prized employees because they help bring positive perspective to the workplace. Likewise, someone with a negative attitude is usually someone that most people prefer not to work with. The problem with a negative attitude is that it has a devastating effect on everyone else. Have you ever felt really happy after a great day and when you got home, your roommate was in a terrible mood because of her bad day? In this situation, you can almost feel yourself deflating! This is why having a positive attitude is a key component to having good human relations at work and in our personal lives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p04">But how do we change a negative attitude? Because a negative attitude can come from many sources, there are also many sources that can help us improve our attitude.</p>

            <span class="blockquote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p05">Reams are written about improving your attitude; not so when it comes to defining that thing you’re trying to improve. In this checklist, we’re going to fix that.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p06">Though there are many ways to define attitude, I find the three checkpoints below to be the most helpful. They make it clear not only what your attitude is made of but also how it affects what you do.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="simpara">1. How You Enter</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_bl02">
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p07">Before heading down South for a vacation, I expected a relaxing and enjoyable time. This is the first piece of your attitude: it is what you expect before something happens.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p08">For me, I expected good things. Someone with a more negative bent—at least in relation to traveling—would predict rough times ahead.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="simpara">2. How You Live through It</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_bl03">
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p09">The second piece of your attitude is the way in which you gauge progress. Do you notice what is going wrong? Going well? Somewhere in between?</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p10">I went to dinner the other night with a few friends. I’m always on the lookout for stories to use on the site, so when they started to comment on the place, I was drawn in. One friend noticed how noisy the restaurant was, how grumpy the waiter seemed, and how bad the food tasted.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p11">On the heels of this cheery testimonial, the friend sitting next to me said she loved the atmosphere, the style of the tables, and her dinner. Two attitudes looking for very different things.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="simpara">3. How You Exit</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_bl04">
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p12">The last role your attitude plays happens at the end of a situation or experience. At this point, your attitude affects the way you sum things up.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p13">I was watching a competition-based reality show the other night and, when two people were sent home, they were given the chance to talk to the camera one last time.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p14">They were asked what they would take away from the experience. The first reflected on the friendships he had made and the good times he had had. The second was angry and vengeful. To her, the experience was a waste of time. Attitude strikes again.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p16">As <a class="xref" href="#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_n01">Note 1.19 "Changing Your Attitude"</a> points out, our attitude is ultimately about how we set our expectations; how we handle the situation when our expectations are not met; and finally, how we sum up an experience, person, or situation. When we focus on improving our attitude on a daily basis, we get used to thinking positively and our entire personality can change. It goes without saying that employers prefer to hire and promote someone with a positive attitude as opposed to a negative one. Other tips for improving attitude include the following:<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_012">Richard Whitaker, “Improving Your Attitude,” Biznick, September 2, 2008, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://biznik.com/articles/improving-your-attitude">http://biznik.com/articles/improving-your-attitude</a></span></p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>When you wake up in the morning, decide you are going to have an excellent day. By having this attitude, it is less likely you may feel disappointed when small things do not go your way.</li>
            <li>Be conscious of your negative thoughts. Keep a journal of negative thoughts. Upon reviewing them, analyze why you had a negative thought about a specific situation.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid negative thinking. Think of a stop sign in your mind that stops you when you have negative thoughts. Try to turn those thoughts into positive ones. For example, instead of saying, “I am terrible in math,” say, “I didn’t do well on that test. It just means I will study harder next time.”</li>
            <li>Spend time with positive people. All of us likely have a friend who always seems to be negative or a coworker who constantly complains. People like this can negatively affect our attitude, too, so steering clear when possible, or limiting the interaction time, is a great way to keep a positive attitude intact.</li>
            <li>Spend time in a comfortable physical environment. If your mattress isn’t comfortable and you aren’t getting enough sleep, it is more difficult to have a positive attitude! Or if the light in your office is too dark, it might be more difficult to feel positive about the day. Look around and examine your physical space. Does it match the mental frame of mind you want to be in?</li>

It is a good idea to reflect often on what aspects of our personality are working well and which we might like to change. With self-awareness (discussed further in <a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Achieve Personal Success"</a>), we can make changes that eventually result in better human relations.</p>

            <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p19">Our personality traits, attitude, and self-esteem have everything to do with human relations. When you are planting a vegetable garden, you wouldn’t fill the new garden with old soil that no longer has nutrients in it. Doing this will result in your plants not growing as large as they can or could even result in them not growing at all. If we look at our human relations ability, the same idea applies. <strong class="emphasis bold">Personality, attitude, and self-esteem comprise the nutrient-rich soil required for our human relations skills to grow.</strong> Our personality is how we see the world, either positive and full of hope or negative and full of despair. <strong class="emphasis bold">Without a positive attitude, it can be difficult to relate to others—because they may not want to be around us!</strong> Likewise, having a positive self-image can give us the confidence to nurture relationships, resulting in positive human relations as well. <strong class="emphasis bold">Just like the garden that needs soils rich in nutrients, our human relations skills are the same.</strong> To make our human relations skills grow, we need to look at our underlying personality characteristics, attitudes, and self-esteem that could be helping—or hindering—our ability to relate to others.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Does Perception Matter to Human Relations?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01">As we have discussed so far in this chapter, many things impact our human relations with others. Perception is no different. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Perception</a><span class="glossdef">The recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli based upon our memory.</span></span> is the recognition and interpretation of sensory stimuli based upon our memory. In other words, it is the way you interpret data around you. The data could come from sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. For example, if you wake up in the morning to the smell of coffee, your perception is likely correct that your roommate is already awake. The challenge with perception in human relations is that we may not always understand someone else’s perception and/or assume their perception is our own. This is where disagreements and other communication issues can occur. For example, if you perceive that your significant other is too focused on spending time with friends, your interactions with her will be based upon this perception. For example, you could be frustrated and short tempered. In a workplace setting, perceptions can also cause miscommunications. For example, you may perceive your coworker to be lazy because he always arrives to work at 8:15 a.m. and the start time is 8 a.m. Suppose he has a child with a medical condition who needs special schooling, and the school doesn’t open until 8 a.m.? Perhaps he has made arrangements with your supervisor of which you are unaware. This perception can be a dangerous one, since we don’t have all of the facts.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Influences Our Perception?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01">We have defined perception and given some example to show how perceptions can be incorrect—negatively impacting relationships. But where do our perceptions come from? There are a number of things that influence our perception.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_013">Rita Baltus, <em class="emphasis">Personal Psychology for Life and Work</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000), 27–29.</span> First, our heredity can be major influencers of our perception. Height, skin color, and gender influence the way we see the world. For example, someone who is 5’ 2” may perceive an object to be stored too high, while someone who is 6’ 2” may not have that same perception.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p02">Our needs impact our perception as well. Physiological needs, such as food and water (or lack thereof), can influence how we feel about certain situations. Have you ever been in a social situation where you were very hungry? If so, you know this impacted your ability to socialize with other people. You may have found yourself less patient to listen because you were concerned about when you were going to eat! Or if you have ever taken a road trip and needed to use the restroom, your perception may be that the highway lacks a sufficient number of rest areas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p03">Our peer group can also impact our perception. Our peers tend to determine what is desirable or undesirable, thereby giving us information on how to interpret data around us. You have experienced this personally, no doubt. If you perceive a brand of clothing desirable, it is more likely your friends also feel similar. The same thing happens at work; for example, suppose a supervisor uses Skype to conduct meetings because her perception is that it is an efficient way to do business. It is highly likely that others in your workgroup will perceive it as a useful tool, also.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p04">Our interests impact our perception. If you like running marathons, your perception on how much to spend on running shoes will be different from someone who prefers kayaking for fun and needs a pair of athletic shoes. Assume your interest at work is to be promoted. Your perception of work is very different than someone who can’t stand the job and is looking for a position with a different company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p05">Our expectations are another driver of our perceptions. For example, research performed by Ronald Melzack<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn01_014">Ronald Melzack et al., “Central Neuropasticy and Pathological Pain,” <em class="emphasis">Annals New York Academy of Sciences</em> 933 (2001): 157–59.</span> suggests our expectations about how much something will hurt alters our perception after the fact. For example, if you are dreading getting a flu shot because you believe it will hurt a lot (expectations), once you actually have it done, you may say, “That didn’t hurt at all” (perception), because your expectation prepared you beforehand. In other words, our expectations affect our perception after the fact. In this example, our expectation was extreme pain, but when that didn’t occur, our perception was quite the opposite. Our expectations and resulting perception can also be looked at in a work setting. For example, if you have high expectations that your workgroup will win the annual chili cook-off at your company picnic, but you don’t win, your perception could be one of unfairness: “The judges like the marketing department better.” Likewise, if your team wins the chili cook-off and you expected to win, your perceptions may be, “Of course we won, we knew ours was the best.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p06">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">halo effect</a><span class="glossdef">Assumes that if a person has one trait we like, that all traits must be desirable.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reverse halo effect</a><span class="glossdef">If we find an undesirable trait in someone, we assume all traits are undesirable.</span></span> can also alter our perceptions. The halo affect assumes that if a person has one trait we like, that all traits must be desirable. The reverse halo effect is if we find an undesirable trait in someone, we assume all traits are undesirable. Assume you don’t like the way your coworker, Mariette, speaks. You may then make an assumption that all of Mariette’s traits are negative. Likewise, if you believe Rhonda is a great dental hygienist, you may promote her to manage the other dental hygienists. Later, if the other hygienists complain about her management style, you may realize you promoted her because you thought her skill as a dental hygienist meant she also had good management skills. In this case, the halo effect occurred.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p07">Awareness of our own perceptions and what drives those perceptions is a key component to being successful at work. If we know why we believe something to be good, right, fair, negative, or unfair based on our perceptions, we can begin to let go of some of our misperceptions. As a result, developing good relationships at work, respect, and mutual understanding can create a better workplace.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">Even if our self-confidence needs improvement, the good news is that there are many ways we can improve it. The following are examples:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use positive self-talk and visual imagery.</strong> Self-talk refers to the things we tell ourselves in quiet moments. It could be, “I did a really good job on that project” or “I am not good in math.” We constantly have an internal dialogue and our subconscious does not know the difference between truth and reality. So when we use negative self-talk, our subconscious actually starts to believe whatever we are telling it! This is why it is important to use positive self-talk. Visual imagery is focusing on a positive outcome and imagining it. By focusing on a positive outcome, we begin to believe it, thereby making it more likely to happen. For example, before you swing a golf club, you may imagine yourself hitting it perfectly with the ball going in just the right direction. This helps get us mentally ready to perform.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take risks.</strong> Risk-taking is an important source of gaining self-confidence. Of course, not all risks work out the way we want them to, but until we take risks, we are unable to accomplish tasks.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Accomplish.</strong> Accomplishing something important such as earning a degree or a promotion can help us gain self-confidence. Of course, as mentioned earlier, often it involves risk taking in order to accomplish.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Know your strengths and weaknesses.</strong> Everyone has a set of things they are good at. Knowing what you are good at and focusing on those things can improve self-esteem. Also, knowing what you are not good at and working to improve those skills can build self-confidence, too.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose to spend time with people who boost your self-esteem.</strong> There are many negative people who do not want anyone to succeed because it makes them feel bad about themselves. Choose friends who boost your self-esteem and limit the time with people who harm your self-esteem.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02">Everyone can continue working on their self-esteem and self-confidence throughout life.

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01_s06_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Human relations</em> is an important part to our career success. It is defined as relations with or between people, particularly in a workplace setting. Because a company depends on good human relations through its organizational structure, developing these skills is important.</li>
            <li>Technology has greatly impacted human relations because so much of our communication occurs without the advantage of seeing body language. This can result in miscommunications. Many workers <em class="emphasis">telecommute</em> to work. There are advantages and disadvantages, a more notable disadvantage being the lack of human, face-to-face contact.</li>
            <li>There was an evolution in human relations study. In the <em class="emphasis">classical school of management</em>, the focus was on efficiency and not on human relations.</li>
            <li>Employees began to unionize in the 1920s due to lack of positive human relations, and therefore the <em class="emphasis">behavioral school of management</em> was created. During this time period, researchers began to focus on the human relations aspect of the workplace. One of the major theories developed was the <em class="emphasis">Hawthorne effect</em>, which determined that workers were more productive when they were being watched and cared about by researchers.</li>
            <li>During the 1950s, the <em class="emphasis">behavioral science approach</em> looked at management techniques as a way to increase productivity and human relations.</li>
            <li>In the 1960s and beyond, sophisticated tools allow researchers to analyze more data and focus on the statistical aspects of human relations and management data.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Personality</em> is defined as a stable set of traits that can explain or predict a person’s behavior in a variety of situations. Our personality affects the way we interact with others. Our personality comes from both environmental factors and some factors we are just born with (nature).</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Values</em> are the things we find important to us. If our values conflict with another’s, there may be a miscommunication or other issues.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Attitudes</em> can be favorable or unfavorable feelings toward people, things, or situations. Our attitudes have a great impact on each other. If one person has a bad attitude, it is likely to be contagious. We can do many things to change our attitude, but all include making a conscious effort to be aware of our negative thoughts and feelings.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Perception</em> refers to how we interpret stimuli such as people, things, or events. Our perception is important to recognize because it is the driving force behind our reaction to things.</li>
            <li>Heredity, needs, peer group, interests, and expectations all influence our perception. A <em class="emphasis">halo effect</em> or <em class="emphasis">reverse halo effect</em> can also influence our perception.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-esteem</em> is defined as the opinion one has about their value as a person. This is different than <em class="emphasis">self-confidence</em>, which refers to the belief someone has in themselves. Both are important determinants to career and human relations success.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-efficacy</em> is the confidence someone has to carry out a specific task. Self-confidence and self-efficacy can come from a variety of sources.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Self-image</em> is how you think others view you, while <em class="emphasis">projection</em> refers to how your self-esteem is reflected in others.</li>
            <li>The <em class="emphasis">Johari window</em> is a tool to look at our own self-esteem and learn how others view us. The Johari window involves the <em class="emphasis">open area</em>, <em class="emphasis">hidden area</em>, <em class="emphasis">blind area</em>, and <em class="emphasis">unknown area</em>.</li>
