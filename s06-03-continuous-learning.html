This shows high emotional intelligence in the area of self-awareness and self-management (“I know I need to learn this new skill to be more valuable to my employee or to be more productive in my personal life”). Having self-awareness, or knowing our strengths and weaknesses, is the first step in improving our chances for career and personal success. Once we are aware (self-aware) of our weaknesses, we can better choose areas in which we would like to learn. For example, if Anton knows he isn’t very good at giving presentations, being able to recognize this is self-awareness. Then, finding opportunities to work on this, such as joining a Toastmasters club, shows emotional intelligence in the area of self-management. Anton recognized his weakness and finds ways to improve his abilities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">People who often learn new skills tend to be happier individuals and more value to their organizations. For example, Zappos, a shoe retailer based in Seattle, Washington, maintains a “Wishez” list. Employees post things they are interested in learning, such as how to cook an ethnic dish, and they are connected with other members in the organization who have these skills. This focus on continuous learning makes for happier employees, which makes for more productive workers. In a study by Kansas State University, it was estimated that happy workers are in fact, more productive. The study found that employees who are psychologically distressed cost $75+ per week to the organization.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_017">Hodges, Kristin. (2009, February 3). K-state researcher says happy employees are critical for an organization’s success.

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p03">Learning new skills such as taking a pottery class or learning to ski or surf can help people increase happiness, which in turn can build self-confidence. This confidence can result in a richer and more fulfilling life since we learn new things that we enjoy doing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p04">Most people who find career success have a habit of being curious and interested in a variety of topics that can enhance their personal lives but also their professional lives, too. As management guru Brian Tracy points out, continuous learning is one of the “nine disciplines” to being successful.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_018">Korn, Marc. (2011, December 8). Self-discipline: The art of continuous learning. Accessed March 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://marckornblog.com/discipline-of-continuous-learning/">http://marckornblog.com/discipline-of-continuous-learning/</a></span> But what does it mean to learn continuously? There are several ways we can learn, as depicted in <a class="xref" href="#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_f01">Figure 2.4 "Some Suggestions for Continual Learning"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p05">From a career perspective, if we choose not to learn continuously, we end up being stale in both our skills and abilities. Since most industries change so quickly, it is likely our current skills will be outdated in five to ten years. This means we need to constantly update to understand the next set of skills we need to be successful. In addition, sometimes we have to “unlearn” skills as new and better ways evolve. For example, if you have golfed before, you may mimic the golf swings you see on television when you go out to play. Although this swing may work for you for some time, you may get to a point where you want to improve, so you take a lesson from a golf pro. The golf pro looks at your swing and offers advice on how to improve distance and accuracy. In this case, you may have to “unlearn” your old swing in order to improve your golf game. Unlearning can apply to all aspects of our life, not just sports. When things in an organization change, it can be challenging to unlearn the old way and be comfortable with the new way of doing things. Unlearning means you may have to let go of an old way of doing something that may have worked for a long period of time. For example, Parelli Natural Horsemanship program requires training participants to start from square one when learning how to train their horse.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_019">Parelli Natural Horse Training website. Accessed May 18, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.parellinaturalhorsetraining.com/natural-horsemanship/">http://www.parellinaturalhorsetraining.com/natural-horsemanship/</a></span> The idea is they need to “unlearn” their old ways of training their horse in order to become effective at the sport. So no matter if someone has ten years of experience with horses or zero years, everyone goes back to basics. This can happen in organizations, too. For example, an organization that had high sales in 2007 had to unlearn their way of doing business before the recession in order to continue being successful. A new economy has required relearning of how to operate with many economic changes. In society today, the ability to learn, unlearn, and then learn again can happen over a span of a few months rather than many years. For example, many organizations get “stuck” on a specific way of doing things, and when those things are unlearned, the company can begin to move forward and learn the new way of doing things.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p06">Many organizations value people who can show their focus and dedication to continually learning and unlearning. For example, the Office of Personnel Management of the US Fish and Wildlife Service employs over 9,000<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_020">US Fish and Wildlife homepage. Accessed March 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fws.gov/help/about_us.html">http://www.fws.gov/help/about_us.html</a></span> people. Because of their large staff, they have identified twenty-eight leadership competencies, one of which is continual learning. Continual learning is important because it makes us more valuable to our employers, which can result in promotions, higher salary, and more responsibility as we grow our career.</p>
