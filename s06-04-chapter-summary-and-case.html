        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s04_l01">
            <li>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is different from intelligence quotient (IQ) in that EQ can help predict career success and can be improved over time, whereas IQ is stable over time.</li>
            <li>Emotional intelligence consists of four main components. Self-awareness is the first. This level of intelligence comprises the ability to understand one’s own emotions and reactions to those emotions.</li>
            <li>Self-management refers to the ability to manage one’s reactions and emotions.</li>
            <li>Social awareness refers to one’s ability to read body language and social cues to develop positive relationships both professionally and personally.</li>
            <li>Relationship management skills require all of the three mentioned skills. This skill allows us to handle conflict and get along with others.</li>
            <li>EQ is important because the majority of successful people have both appropriate IQ levels for their job but also EQ skills.</li>
            <li>Goal setting is a necessary aspect to career success. We must set goals in order to have a map for our life.</li>
            <li>When we set goals, we should use the SMART goals format. This asks us to make sure our goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and have timelines associated with them.</li>
            <li>When setting goals, we will also use objectives. Objectives are the shorter-term things we must do in order to meet our goals. Time management is also a factor to goal setting. Developing good time management skills can bring us closer to our goals.</li>
            <li>Managing our time efficiently is a good way to help us achieve our goals. By looking at time management, we can make sure the time we spend on activities is geared toward meeting our end goals.</li>
            <li>Learning how to deal with change is another way to ensure career success. Many people are adverse to change for a variety of reasons. For example, sometimes it is easier to maintain the status quo because we know what to expect. Other reasons may include concern about financial loss and job security, unclear leadership communication, and the existence of group norms.</li>
            <li>Besides attitude and behavior, career promotion means being uncomfortable with possible changes. People resist change because of fear of job security, fear of the unknown, fear of failure, their individual personality, and bad past experience with change.</li>
            <li>Lewin’s model suggests three phases of change, which include unfreezing, change, and refreezing. These changes indicate that some motivation must occur for the change to happen (unfreeze). Once the change occurs, there can still be discomfort while people are getting used to the new reality. Finally, in the refreezing part, people are beginning to accept the change as the new normal.</li>
            <li>Continual learning is an important part of personal development as well as professional development.</li>
            <li>People who engage in continual learning tend to experience more personal happiness and career success.</li>
            <li>One can engage in continuous learning by taking seminars, workshops, reading, working with a mentor, attending conventions, socializing, and traveling.</li>
