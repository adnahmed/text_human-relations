    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p01">Reegan is highly committed to her company but is having trouble getting along with two of her coworkers. They just don’t seem to like her, even though she has a lot of good ideas to contribute to the team. While she wants to stay with the company, she just doesn’t see that happening with the current work environment. Reegan schedules a meeting with her manager, Lynn, hoping she will have some ideas on how to improve the situation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p02">Lynn listens intently to Reegan’s concerns and says, “Reegan, you are an asset to this organization, with all of your abilities and skills. But as of right now, you are lacking in some areas we should discuss.” Reegan is very upset with this reaction; she expected Lynn to talk with the others in her department and force them to be easier to work with. “First, the perception is that you are not a team player. You spend time in meetings talking about your ideas, but you don’t ask others what they think of those ideas, nor do you seem to notice body language that indicates someone might have something to say,” says Lynn. “Another thing I have noticed is your seemingly unwillingness to engage your coworkers in anything besides work-related tasks. Remember, this team has worked together for over eight years and they have built personal relationships. You don’t seem to be interested in anyone you work with.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p03">Reegan, defensive, says, “No one will say anything when I mention my ideas! It isn’t my fault that they don’t care about bettering this company. They need to speak up if they have comments or ideas of their own. As far as personal life, I am here to work, not make friends.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p04">Lynn sits back in her chair and asks Reegan if she has ever heard of emotional intelligence skills. Reegan hasn’t, so Lynn gives her some websites to check out, and then schedules a meeting to talk in two days about emotional intelligence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p05">This situation in the workplace is not uncommon yet causes thousands of lost work hours and frustrations on the part of managers and employees. Emotional intelligence skills (sometimes referred to as EQ or EI), as we will discuss in this chapter, can help people be aware of their own emotions, manage those emotions, and work better with others. These skills can be developed over time and are an important part of career success.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_p06">Before we begin this chapter, it is important to distinguish between personal and professional success, because personal success does not always mean professional success and the other way around. In addition, personal and professional success means different things to different people. For example, having a nice car, a beautiful home, and a fancy job title could be considered professional success. On the other hand, personal success may include the ability to travel, interpersonal relationships, friendships, and other factors that have little to do with professional success. Consider Desiree—she does not earn large sums of money and does not have a fancy job title. She has never been promoted and has worked as an administrative assistant for twelve years for more or less the same salary. However, she does not have the goal of being promoted and prefers to leave the office at 5 pm and not have to think about work beyond that. She has a rich life full of friends and travel and often takes classes to learn new skills such as pottery and kickboxing. One would not argue that Desiree has achieved success and happiness personally. For her, achieving this is far more important than achieving what many would call professional success. However, we know there is much crossover between skills that can help us achieve both professional and personal success or happiness. Emotional intelligence is one of those skills, which we will discuss in greater detail throughout this chapter.</p>

(2000). Paper presented to annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, New Orleans, LA, April 15, 2000.

(n.d.). Emotional intelligence. Accessed February 26, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://danielgoleman.info/topics/emotional-intelligence/">http://danielgoleman.info/topics/emotional-intelligence/</a></span> According to Goleman, there are four main aspects to emotional intelligence, which we will discuss later in this section. First, why is emotional intelligence necessary for success?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p03">To begin with, different from what was previously thought, IQ is not a good predictor of job performance, happiness, or success. Goleman points out that if this myth were true, everyone who graduated at the top of their class with honors would be the most successful people. Because we know this isn’t the case, we know qualities other than just IQ can help predict success. Research by Travis Bradberry and Jean Greves has shown that EQ makes up 58 percent of our job requirements and is the single biggest predictor of performance in the workplace and the strongest driver of leadership and personal excellence.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_004">Bradberry, Travis, &amp; Greaves, Jean. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Emotional Intelligence 2.0</em> (p. 21) TalentSmart Publishing.</span> Their research also showed that 90 percent of high performers at work had high EQ, while 20 percent of low performers had low EQ. In other words, you can be a high performer at work without EQ, but the chances are slimmer with low EQ.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_005">Bradberry, Travis, &amp; Greaves, Jean. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Emotional Intelligence 2.0</em> (p. 21) TalentSmart Publishing.</span> EQ research by Bradberry and Greves shows a link between higher EQ and higher salary. In fact, for every point increase in EQ, there is a $1,300 per year increase in salary.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_006">Bradberry, Travis, &amp; Greaves, Jean. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Emotional Intelligence 2.0</em> (p. 22) TalentSmart Publishing.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p04">In one study performed by Virginia Tech,<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_007">Virginia Tech. (2005, October 5). Emotional intelligence may be good predictor of success in computing studies. <em class="emphasis">ScienceDaily</em>.</span> six hundred undergraduate computer science students and twenty institutions participated in a survey that measured emotional intelligence and the ability to handle demanding curriculum. Although emotional intelligence was not directly linked to academic success in the study, students with higher levels of emotional intelligence had more self-efficacy (belief in one’s own ability), which allowed them to handle problems better—creating higher academic success. For example, the ability to read body language and understand when someone is sad or mad and needs to talk is an emotional intelligence skill. These skills enable us to interact with others successfully. Consider a person who does not have a “filter” and continually puts down others and says exactly what is on their mind, even if it is hurtful. This clear lack of emotional intelligence affects this person’s ability to have good, healthy relationships, both at work and in their personal life.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p05">So, we know that emotional intelligence is important for success at work, at school, and in our personal lives. Let’s discuss the four main components of EQ:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Self-awareness.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-awareness</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to the ability of a person to understand how they are feeling from moment to moment.</span></span> refers to a person’s ability to understand their feelings from moment to moment. It might seem as if this is something we know, but we often go about our day without thinking or being aware of our emotions that impact how we behave in work or personal situations. Understanding our emotions can help us reduce stress and make better decisions, especially when we are under pressure. In addition, knowing and recognizing our own strengths and weaknesses is part of self-awareness. Assume that Patt is upset about a new process being implemented in the organization. Lack of self-awareness may result in her feeling angry and anxious, without really knowing why. High self-awareness EQ might cause Patt to recognize that her anger and anxiety stem from the last time the organization changed processes and fifteen people got laid off. Part of self-awareness is the idea of positive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">psychological capital</a><span class="glossdef">Positive emotions such as hope and optimism, which result in higher confidence and resilience.</span></span>, which can include emotions such as hope; optimism, which results in higher confidence; and resilience, or the ability to bounce back quickly from challenges.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_008">Luthans, Fred. (2002). The need for and meaning of positive organizational behavior. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Organizational Behavior, 23</em>(6), 695–706.</span> Psychological capital can be gained through self-awareness and self-management, which is our next area of emotional intelligence.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Self-management.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-management</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to our ability to manage our emotions and is dependent on our self-awareness ability.</span></span> refers to our ability to manage our emotions and is dependent on our self-awareness ability. How do we handle frustration, anger, and sadness? Are we able to control our behaviors and emotions? Self-management also is the ability to follow through with commitments and take initiative at work. Someone who lacks self-awareness may project stress on others. For example, say that project manager Mae is very stressed about an upcoming Monday deadline. Lack of self-management may cause Mae to lash out at people in the office because of the deadline. Higher EQ in this area might result in Mae being calm, cool, and collected—to motivate her team to focus and finish the project on time.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social awareness.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social awareness</a><span class="glossdef">Our ability to understand social cues that may be affecting others around us.</span></span> is our ability to understand social cues that may affect others around us. In other words, understanding how another is feeling, even if we do not feel the same way. Social awareness also includes having empathy for another, recognizing power structure and unwritten workplace dynamics. Most people high on social awareness have charisma and make people feel good with every interaction. For example, consider Erik’s behavior in meetings. He continually talks and does not pick up subtleties, such as body language. Because of this, he can’t understand (or even fathom) that his monologues can be frustrating to others. Erik, with higher EQ in social awareness, may begin talking but also spend a lot of time listening and observing in the meeting, to get a sense of how others feel. He may also directly ask people how they feel. This demonstrates high social awareness.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Relationship management.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Relationship management</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to our ability to communicate clearly, maintain good relationships with others, work well in teams, and manage conflict.</span></span> refers to our ability to communicate clearly, maintain good relationships with others, work well in teams, and manage conflict. Relationship management relies on your ability to use the other three areas of EQ to manage relationships effectively. Take Caroline, for example. Caroline is good at reading people’s emotions and showing empathy for them, even if she doesn’t agree. As a manager, her door is always open and she makes it clear to colleagues and staff that they are welcome to speak with her anytime. If Caroline has low EQ in the area of relationship management, she may belittle people and have a difficult time being positive. She may not be what is considered a good team player, which shows her lack of ability to manage relationships.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p06">To increase our self-awareness skills, we should spend time thinking about our emotions to understand why we experience a specific emotion. We should look at those things that cause a strong reaction, such as anger to help us understand the underlying reasons for that reaction. By doing this, we can begin to see a pattern within ourselves that helps explain how we behave and how we feel in certain situations. This allows us to handle those situations when they arise.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p07">To increase our self-management skills, we can focus on the positive instead of the negative. Taking deep breaths increases blood flow, which helps us handle difficult situations. Although seemingly childish, counting to ten before reacting can help us manage emotions such as anger. This gives us time to calm down and think about how we will handle the situation. Practicing positive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-talk</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to the thoughts we have about ourselves and situations throughout the day.</span></span> can help increase our self-management. Self-talk refers to the thoughts we have about ourselves and situations throughout the day. Since we have over 50,000 thoughts per day,<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_009">Willax, Paul. (1999, December 13).

By recognizing the negative thoughts, we can change them for the positive. The following are some examples:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p08">Increasing social awareness means to observe others’ actions and to watch people to get a good sense of how they are reacting. We can gain social awareness skills by learning people’s names and making sure we watch body language. Living in the moment can help our interactions with others as well. Practicing listening skills and asking follow-up questions can also help improve our social awareness skills.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p09">Strategies for relationship management might include being open, acknowledging another’s feelings, and showing that you care. Being willing to listen to colleagues and employees and understanding them on a personal level can help enhance relationship management skills. Being willing to accept feedback and grow from that feedback can help people be more comfortable talking with you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_p10">The importance of emotional intelligence, as we introduced at the start of this section, is imperative to being successful at work. Figuring out a plan on how we can increase our emotional intelligence skills can also benefit us personally in our relationships with others.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s01_l04">
            <li>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is different from intelligence quotient (IQ) in that EQ can help predict career success and can be improved over time, whereas IQ is stable over time.</li>
            <li>Emotional intelligence consists of four main components. Self-awareness is the first. This level of intelligence comprises the ability to understand one’s own emotions and reactions to those emotions.</li>
            <li>Self-management refers to the ability to manage one’s reactions and emotions.</li>
            <li>Social awareness refers to one’s ability to read body language and social cues to develop positive relationships both professionally and personally.</li>
            <li>Relationship management skills require all of the three mentioned skills. This skill allows us to handle conflict and get along with others.</li>
            <li>EQ is important because the majority of successful people have both appropriate IQ levels for their job and EQ skills.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">As we discussed, our emotional intelligence is the cornerstone for career success. Part of self-management is knowing ourselves and being able to set goals based on understanding our own needs and wants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Many people end up adrift in life, with no real goal or purpose, which can show lack of self-management. Some people are happy this way, but most people would prefer to have goals that can set the direction for their life. It is similar to going on a road trip without a map or GPS. You might have fun for a while, going where the wind takes you, but at some point you may like to see specific things or stop at certain places, which creates the need for GPS. What happens if you have been driving aimlessly for a while but decide what you want to see is five hundred miles back the other way? A goal would have helped you plan the steps along the way in your trip. Goals are the GPS for your life. Research done by Locke et al. in the late 1960s shows a direct connection between goal setting and high achievement.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_010">Locke, Edwin A., Shaw, Karyll N., Saari, Lise M., &amp; Latham, Gary P. (1981). Goal setting and task performance: 1969–1980. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 90</em>(1), 125–52.</span> One of the most popular methods to setting goals is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SMART philosophy</a><span class="glossdef">A strategy to use when setting goals; includes goals being specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, and time-oriented.</span></span>. This includes the following “steps” or aspects to goal setting:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Specific.</strong> First, the goals need to be specific. Rather than saying, “I want to be a better person,” try a goal such as “volunteer two hours per week.” The more specific the goal, the more we are able to determine if we were successful in that goal. In other words, being specific allows us to be very clear about what we want to achieve. This clarity helps us understand specifically what we need to do in order to achieve the goal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Measurable.</strong> The goal must be measured. At the end of the time period, you should be able to say, “Yes, I met that goal.” For example, “increase my sales” isn’t measureable. Saying something such as, “I will increase my sales by 10 percent over the next two years,” is very specific and measureable. At the end of two years, you can look at how well you have performed and compare your goal with the result.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Attainable.</strong> The goals should be something we can achieve. We must either already have or be able to develop the attitudes, skills, and abilities in order to achieve the goal. This doesn’t mean you need these skills right now, but it does mean over time you should be able to develop them. For example, if my goal is to become a light aircraft pilot, but I am afraid of flying, it may mean I am not willing (or able) to develop the skills and abilities in order to achieve this goal. So this goal would not be attainable and I should choose another one.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Realistic.</strong> The goal that is set must be something you are willing <em class="emphasis">and</em> able to work toward. The goal cannot be someone else’s goal. For example, earning a business degree because your parents want you to may not be compelling enough to follow through with that goal. The goal should be realistic in terms of your abilities and willingness to work toward the goal. If I decided I wanted to be a WNBA player, this is probably not a realistic goal for me. I am too old; I am five feet two inches and not really willing to put in the time to get better at basketball. So as a result, I would likely not achieve this goal.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Time-oriented.</strong> There should always be a timeframe attached to a specific goal. Most individuals will have longer-term and shorter-term goals. For example, a long-term goal might be to manage a medical lab. In order to meet this longer-term goal, shorter-term goals might include the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l02">
                    <li>Earn a medical lab technology degree</li>
                    <li>Obtain employment as a medical lab tech</li>
                    <li>Develop skills by attending two conferences per year</li>
                    <li>Develop positive relationship with coworkers and supervisor by using emotional intelligence skills</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p03">Within all of our goals, there are shorter-term objectives. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Objectives</a><span class="glossdef">The shorter-term goals we must do in order to accomplish our bigger goals.</span></span> are the shorter-term goals we must do in order to accomplish our bigger goals. For example, possible objectives for two of the goals mentioned previously might be the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l03">
            <li>
                <p class="para">Earn a medical lab technology degree</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l04">
                    <li>Take three courses per quarter to finish in two years</li>
                    <li>Study at least three to six hours per day to earn a 3.5 GPA or higher</li>
                    <li>See my advisor once per quarter</li>
                    <li>Slot one night per week for social time, but focus on studies the rest of the time</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Obtain employment as a medical lab tech</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l05">
                    <li>Do an internship in the last quarter of school</li>
                    <li>Create a dynamic resume</li>
                    <li>Obtain recommendations from instructors</li>
                    <li>Attend the quarterly medical lab networking event while in school</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p04">Another effective strategy in goal setting is writing goals down.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_011">Locke, E. A., &amp; Latham, G. P. (1990). <em class="emphasis">A theory of goal-setting and task performance</em>. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.</span> Why is this so important? First, you are forced to clarify and think about specific goals using SMART objectives. Second, writing goals down can turn your direction into the right one, and you will be less likely to be sidetracked by other things. Writing goals down and revisiting them often can also provide an outlet for helping you celebrate meeting a certain objective. In our previous example, by writing these things down, we are able to celebrate the smaller successes such as earning a 3.7 GPA or finishing an internship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p05">Research performed published in the <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management</em> journal also suggests that goals are much more likely to be met if the goal is set by the person attaining the goal.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_012">Shalley, Christina E. (1995, April). Effects of coaction, expected evaluation, and goal setting on creativity and productivity. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal, 38</em>(2), 483–503.</span> For example, if Sherry’s parents want her to become a dental hygienist, but she really wants to become an automotive technician, achieving the goal of dental hygienist may be more difficult, because it’s not her own. While this may seem obvious, we can easily take on goals that other people want us to achieve—even well into our adult life. Expectations from our partner, spouse, friends, and social group can influence our goals and make them not our own. For example, if in your group of friends all have the goal of becoming lawyers, we can assume this should be our goal, too. As a result, we may try to meet this goal but be unsuccessful or unmotivated because it isn’t truly what we want.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p06">Another thing to consider about goal setting is that as we change, and situations change, we need to be flexible with them. For example, let’s say Phil has a goal of earning a degree in marketing. Suppose Phil takes his first marketing class but creates a great idea for a new business he would like to start once he graduates. At this point, Phil may decide earning an entrepreneurship degree instead makes the most sense. It is likely, as a result, since Phil’s goal has changed, objectives and timelines may need to change as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p07">Revisiting our goals often is an important part to goal setting. One of the most popular examples for rigidity in goal setting was Ford. In 1969, the goal was to develop a car that weighed less than 2,000 pounds and was less than $2,000. This was to be done by the model year 1971. As you know, this was a very short time to reengineer and redesign everything the organization had done in the past. Ford met their goal, as the Ford Pinto was introduced in 1971.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_013">Why Goal Setting can Lead to Disaster. (2012, May 15). <em class="emphasis">Forbes Magazine</em>, accessed May 15, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/19/setting-goals-wharton-entrepreneurs-management_wharton.html">http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/19/setting-goals-wharton-entrepreneurs-management_wharton.html</a></span> However, due to the rush to meet the goal, common safety procedures were not followed in the development process, which resulted in disaster. Engineers did not look at the safety issues in placement of the fuel tank, which resulted in fifty-three deaths when the car went up in flames after minor crashes. While this is an extreme example, revisiting goals, including timelines, is also an important part of the goal-setting process.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Why Human Relations?</h3>
            <p class="para">In a 2005 study<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_014">Knight, Jennifer. (2005). <em class="emphasis">Exploring emotional intelligence and IQ: Comparing violent and non-violent criminal offenders.</em> Dissertation, accessed May 16, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=913522881&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId%20=79356&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD">http://proquest.umi.com/pqdlink?did=913522881&amp;Fmt=7&amp;clientId =79356&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD</a></span> that compared violence and emotional intelligence, inmates were divided into nonviolent offenses and violent offenses. When emotional intelligence was measured, there was a clear difference between emotional intelligence deficiencies and violence as a vehicle to act out emotions. This, of course, is an extreme example, but it proves the point: <strong class="emphasis bold">the ability to understand our emotions allows us to be better prepared to handle those emotions appropriately, which in turn can create success personally and at work</strong>. It allows us to create coping tools to deal with emotions such as anger and frustration.</p>
            <p class="para">The ability to manage ourselves helps us handle our emotions but also allows us to handle ourselves in other ways. For example, <strong class="emphasis bold">practicing self-management can teach us how to forgo immediate gratification to meet our goals, a necessary skill to create the kind of life you want</strong>. Time management, handling change, and other skills allow us to be successful personally and professionally.</p>
            <p class="para">Social awareness is a skill that helps us to see how we are affecting others. Often, we can get too tied up with ourselves and we fail to notice how another person is feeling. Someone who “gets” the social cues, for example, <strong class="emphasis bold">can develop positive working relationships and motivate people</strong>.</p>
            <p class="para">Relationship management can help us foster skills that help us maintain good working relationships with others. Learning how to handle conflict and communicate well are necessary skills to have a successful marriage, relationship, friendship, and work relationships.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p01">Part of reaching goals also refers to our ability to manage our time.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Learning how to prioritize. Develop the skills of making sure the most important things are done first (even if they are less fun).</li>
            <li>Avoid multitasking. Focus on one task and finish it before moving on.</li>
            <li>Don’t get distracted—for example, with e-mails, text messages, or other communications—while working. Set time aside to check these things.</li>
            <li>Make to-do lists. These lists can be daily, weekly, or monthly. Organizing in this way will help you keep track of tasks and deadlines. However, note that a study by the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> suggested 30 percent of people spend more time managing their to-do list than actually doing the work on them.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_015">Sandberg, Jared.

            <li>Don’t overwork yourself. Schedule time for breaks and spend time doing things you enjoy.</li>
            <li>Be organized. Make sure your workspace, computer, and home are organized so you can find things easier. Much time is wasted looking for a file on a computer or a specific item you misplaced.</li>
            <li>Understand your work style, a self-awareness skill. Some people work better in the morning, while others work better at night. Schedule important tasks for times when you are at your peak.</li>
            <li>Don’t say yes to everything. Everyone has a limit, and being able to say no is an important part of managing time.</li>
            <li>Find ways to improve concentration. Learning how to meditate for twenty minutes a day or exercising, for example, can help focus your energy.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dealing with Change</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p01">As we discussed, the ability to set goals is part of emotional intelligence. Perhaps equally as important, being flexible with our goals and understanding that things will change—which can affect the direction of our goals—is part of being emotionally intelligent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p02">Dealing with change can be difficult. Since most businesses are always in a state of flux, for career success, it is important we learn how to handle change effectively. But first, why do people tend to resist change? There are many reasons why:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">People are afraid the change will affect the value of their skills.</strong> For example, if people are afraid of new technology, this could be because they are nervous their skills on the old technology will no longer be useful to the company. To combat this concern, use a can-do attitude about these kinds of changes. Be the first to sign up for training, since we know technological change is a constant.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">People are concerned about financial loss.</strong> Many people worry about how the change will affect them from a financial perspective. Will it result in lost hours, lost income? If a change is introduced and you aren’t sure how it will affect these things—and it is not effectively communicated—the best course of action is to talk with your supervisor to clarify how exactly this change will affect you.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Status quo is easier.</strong> People get comfortable. Because of this comfort level, change and the unknown seem scary. Try to always look for new ways to enhance and improve the workplace. For example, revisiting and improving the process for scheduling can help us from becoming stagnant.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Group norms exist.</strong> Sometimes team members are happy to change, but the company does not have a culture that embraces change. Listening to people’s ideas and reacting positively to them can help create a climate of change. Avoiding defensiveness and “going along with the crowd” can help combat this reason for not embracing change.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Leadership is required.</strong> The leadership in our organizations may not provide all of the information we need, or we may not trust them enough to lead us through a change. Despite this, change is inevitable, so obtaining clarification around the change expectations can be an important step to not only understanding the change, but helping the leader become a better leader.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p03">When a change occurs or is occurring, people are likely to experience four phases associated with that change. First, they may experience denial. In this phase, they do not want to accept the change nor do they want to move on to the future. In the resistance phase, people may feel angry or hurt. They may wistfully think about how great things were before the change. In the third phase, exploration, the person may begin to accept the change but with some reservations. In this phase there may be confusion as people start to clarify expectations. In the commitment phase, people have accepted the change, understand how they fit with the change, know how the change will affect them, and begin to embrace it. For example, assume Alan is an expert on the company’s most popular product offering, a special computer program used for accounting purposes. He is the organization’s top seller, with many of his commissions coming from this product. However, the company has just developed new accounting software, which has much better features for customers. He might find this adjustment difficult because he is comfortable with the current software, and it has been lucrative for him to sell it. Here is how he might go through the phases:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Denial.</strong> Alan does nothing. He continues about his job and ignores e-mails about the new product.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Resistance.</strong> Alan tells his coworkers that the change is unnecessary and wonders why they can’t continue selling the old product. He discusses why the old product is much better than the new one. He may complain to his manager and find reasons why the change is a bad idea.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exploration.</strong> Alan is still nervous about the change but begins to use the new software and realizes it may have some worthwhile features. He wonders how that affects his ability to sell the product, and he begins to think about how he might sell the new software.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Commitment.</strong> Alan takes some training classes on the new product and realizes how much better it is. He talks with his coworkers about the new product and helps them understand how it works. He sends an e-mail to his customers introducing the new software and all of its benefits.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p04">As you can see in this example, Alan’s resistance to the change was because he didn’t understand the need to change at first and he was worried about how this change would affect the value of his skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p05">Because of technology changes and the fact that many companies have global operations and the need for businesses to be agile, change is a constant force affecting business. Be positive about change and accept it as a necessary part of our work life. We cannot expect things to stay the same for very long. The better we can get at accepting change, the more successful we will likely be in our career.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_l03">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unfreezing.</strong> Friction causes change and reduction of forces cause a change to happen. For example, suppose Gillian has been unhappy in her job for three years. She recently gets a new manager who she doesn’t like, and a friend tells her about a job at a competing company. In this case, friction occurred (the new manager). In addition, Gillian was worried she wouldn’t be able to find another job, but now that she knows about a new job, that reduces the forces that prevented her from changing to begin with.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Change.</strong> Now that motivations to change have occurred, the change needs to actually occur. Change is a process, not one event at one time. For example, assume Gillian realized taking the new job makes sense, but even though she knows this, accepting the offer and going to her new job on the first day is still scary!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Refreezing.</strong> Once the change has been made, the refreezing process (which can take years or days, depending on the change) is where the change is the new “normal.” People form new relationships and get more comfortable with their routines. Gillian, for example, likely felt odd taking a different way to her new job and didn’t know where to have lunch. Gradually, though, she began to meet people, got used to her new commute, and settled in.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_l04">
                <li>Goal setting is a necessary aspect to career success. We must set goals in order to have a map for our life.</li>
                <li>When we set goals, we should use the SMART goals format. This asks us to make sure our goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-oriented.</li>
                <li>When setting goals, we will also use objectives. Objectives are the shorter-term things we must do in order to meet our goals.</li>
                <li>Time management is also a factor to goal setting. Developing good time management skills can bring us closer to our goals.</li>
                <li>Learning how to deal with change is another way to ensure career success. Many people are adverse to change for a variety of reasons. For example, sometimes it is easier to maintain status quo because we know what to expect. Other reasons may include concern about financial loss and job security, unclear leadership communication, and the existence of group norms.</li>
                <li>Besides attitude and behavior, career promotion means being uncomfortable with possible changes. People resist change because of fear of job security, fear of the unknown, fear of failure, their individual personality, and bad past experience with change.</li>
                <li>Lewin’s model suggests three phases of change, which include unfreezing, change, and refreezing. These changes indicate that some motivation must occur for the change to happen (unfreeze). Once the change occurs, there can still be discomfort while people get used to the new reality. Finally, in the refreezing part, people are beginning to accept the change as the new normal.</li>

This shows high emotional intelligence in the area of self-awareness and self-management (“I know I need to learn this new skill to be more valuable to my employee or to be more productive in my personal life”). Having self-awareness, or knowing our strengths and weaknesses, is the first step in improving our chances for career and personal success. Once we are aware (self-aware) of our weaknesses, we can better choose areas in which we would like to learn. For example, if Anton knows he isn’t very good at giving presentations, being able to recognize this is self-awareness. Then, finding opportunities to work on this, such as joining a Toastmasters club, shows emotional intelligence in the area of self-management. Anton recognized his weakness and finds ways to improve his abilities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p02">People who often learn new skills tend to be happier individuals and more value to their organizations. For example, Zappos, a shoe retailer based in Seattle, Washington, maintains a “Wishez” list. Employees post things they are interested in learning, such as how to cook an ethnic dish, and they are connected with other members in the organization who have these skills. This focus on continuous learning makes for happier employees, which makes for more productive workers. In a study by Kansas State University, it was estimated that happy workers are in fact, more productive. The study found that employees who are psychologically distressed cost $75+ per week to the organization.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_017">Hodges, Kristin. (2009, February 3). K-state researcher says happy employees are critical for an organization’s success.

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p03">Learning new skills such as taking a pottery class or learning to ski or surf can help people increase happiness, which in turn can build self-confidence. This confidence can result in a richer and more fulfilling life since we learn new things that we enjoy doing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p04">Most people who find career success have a habit of being curious and interested in a variety of topics that can enhance their personal lives but also their professional lives, too. As management guru Brian Tracy points out, continuous learning is one of the “nine disciplines” to being successful.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_018">Korn, Marc. (2011, December 8). Self-discipline: The art of continuous learning. Accessed March 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://marckornblog.com/discipline-of-continuous-learning/">http://marckornblog.com/discipline-of-continuous-learning/</a></span> But what does it mean to learn continuously? There are several ways we can learn, as depicted in <a class="xref" href="#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_f01">Figure 2.4 "Some Suggestions for Continual Learning"</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p05">From a career perspective, if we choose not to learn continuously, we end up being stale in both our skills and abilities. Since most industries change so quickly, it is likely our current skills will be outdated in five to ten years. This means we need to constantly update to understand the next set of skills we need to be successful. In addition, sometimes we have to “unlearn” skills as new and better ways evolve. For example, if you have golfed before, you may mimic the golf swings you see on television when you go out to play. Although this swing may work for you for some time, you may get to a point where you want to improve, so you take a lesson from a golf pro. The golf pro looks at your swing and offers advice on how to improve distance and accuracy. In this case, you may have to “unlearn” your old swing in order to improve your golf game. Unlearning can apply to all aspects of our life, not just sports. When things in an organization change, it can be challenging to unlearn the old way and be comfortable with the new way of doing things. Unlearning means you may have to let go of an old way of doing something that may have worked for a long period of time. For example, Parelli Natural Horsemanship program requires training participants to start from square one when learning how to train their horse.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_019">Parelli Natural Horse Training website. Accessed May 18, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.parellinaturalhorsetraining.com/natural-horsemanship/">http://www.parellinaturalhorsetraining.com/natural-horsemanship/</a></span> The idea is they need to “unlearn” their old ways of training their horse in order to become effective at the sport. So no matter if someone has ten years of experience with horses or zero years, everyone goes back to basics. This can happen in organizations, too. For example, an organization that had high sales in 2007 had to unlearn their way of doing business before the recession in order to continue being successful. A new economy has required relearning of how to operate with many economic changes. In society today, the ability to learn, unlearn, and then learn again can happen over a span of a few months rather than many years. For example, many organizations get “stuck” on a specific way of doing things, and when those things are unlearned, the company can begin to move forward and learn the new way of doing things.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s03_p06">Many organizations value people who can show their focus and dedication to continually learning and unlearning. For example, the Office of Personnel Management of the US Fish and Wildlife Service employs over 9,000<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn02_020">US Fish and Wildlife homepage. Accessed March 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fws.gov/help/about_us.html">http://www.fws.gov/help/about_us.html</a></span> people. Because of their large staff, they have identified twenty-eight leadership competencies, one of which is continual learning. Continual learning is important because it makes us more valuable to our employers, which can result in promotions, higher salary, and more responsibility as we grow our career.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02_s04_l01">
            <li>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is different from intelligence quotient (IQ) in that EQ can help predict career success and can be improved over time, whereas IQ is stable over time.</li>
            <li>Emotional intelligence consists of four main components. Self-awareness is the first. This level of intelligence comprises the ability to understand one’s own emotions and reactions to those emotions.</li>
            <li>Self-management refers to the ability to manage one’s reactions and emotions.</li>
            <li>Social awareness refers to one’s ability to read body language and social cues to develop positive relationships both professionally and personally.</li>
            <li>Relationship management skills require all of the three mentioned skills. This skill allows us to handle conflict and get along with others.</li>
            <li>EQ is important because the majority of successful people have both appropriate IQ levels for their job but also EQ skills.</li>
            <li>Goal setting is a necessary aspect to career success. We must set goals in order to have a map for our life.</li>
            <li>When we set goals, we should use the SMART goals format. This asks us to make sure our goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and have timelines associated with them.</li>
            <li>When setting goals, we will also use objectives. Objectives are the shorter-term things we must do in order to meet our goals. Time management is also a factor to goal setting. Developing good time management skills can bring us closer to our goals.</li>
            <li>Managing our time efficiently is a good way to help us achieve our goals. By looking at time management, we can make sure the time we spend on activities is geared toward meeting our end goals.</li>
            <li>Learning how to deal with change is another way to ensure career success. Many people are adverse to change for a variety of reasons. For example, sometimes it is easier to maintain the status quo because we know what to expect. Other reasons may include concern about financial loss and job security, unclear leadership communication, and the existence of group norms.</li>
            <li>Besides attitude and behavior, career promotion means being uncomfortable with possible changes. People resist change because of fear of job security, fear of the unknown, fear of failure, their individual personality, and bad past experience with change.</li>
            <li>Lewin’s model suggests three phases of change, which include unfreezing, change, and refreezing. These changes indicate that some motivation must occur for the change to happen (unfreeze). Once the change occurs, there can still be discomfort while people are getting used to the new reality. Finally, in the refreezing part, people are beginning to accept the change as the new normal.</li>
            <li>Continual learning is an important part of personal development as well as professional development.</li>
            <li>People who engage in continual learning tend to experience more personal happiness and career success.</li>
            <li>One can engage in continuous learning by taking seminars, workshops, reading, working with a mentor, attending conventions, socializing, and traveling.</li>
