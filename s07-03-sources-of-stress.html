        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p01">As we have studied so far in this chapter, we can experience a number of possible stressors. We can divide these stressors into personal stresses and work stresses. Although we divide them for purposes of ease, it is intuitive that if someone is experiencing personal stress, he or she will also experience it at work, which will result in lessened workplace performance. In fact, the American Institute of Stress estimates that workplace stress costs companies $300 billion annually. This cost is a result of increased absenteeism, employee turnover, and higher medical and insurance costs due to stress related illness and worker productivity.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_014">The American Institute of Stress, “Stress in the Workplace,” accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/">http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p02">According to the American Institute of Stress,<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_015">The American Institute of Stress, “Stress in the Workplace,” accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/">http://www.stress.org/workplace-stress/</a></span> some of the common causes of workplace stress include the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Long hours and increased demands.</strong> The average American works forty-six hours per week.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_016">The Library Spot, “National Sleep Foundation Study,” accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.libraryspot.com/know/workweek.htm">http://www.libraryspot.com/know/workweek.htm</a></span> Much of this is due to increased technology and expectations that employees will be available to answer e-mail on weekends and evenings. As a result of this added work time, employees find less time to engage in leisure and household activities such as grocery shopping and cleaning.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Being treated unfairly.</strong> Workplace issues such as harassment and bullying (both discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesedias_1.0-ch03#portolesedias_1.0-ch03">Chapter 10 "Manage Diversity at Work"</a>) can cause people to feel stress at work. Additional issues such as feeling overlooked for promotions can also cause workplace stress. In extreme cases, perceived workplace unfairness can result in violence. For example, Matthew Beck shot and killed four supervisors in a Connecticut lottery office because he felt he had been unfairly overlooked for a promotion.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_017">Johnathan Rabinnoviz, “Lottery Personnel Shows Lottery Killer Came Back Early from Leave,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 12, 1988, accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/12/nyregion/lottery-personnel-file-shows-killer-came-back-to-work-early-from-a-leave.html?ref=matthewbeck">http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/12/nyregion/lottery-personnel-file-shows-killer-came-back-to-work-early-from-a-leave.html? ref=matthewbeck</a></span> Many organizations offer <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Employee Assistance Programs</a><span class="glossdef">Programs offered by companies that provide services, such as counseling, to help deal with workplace stress and other personal issues.</span></span> that can offer services, such as counseling, to help deal with workplace stress and other personal issues.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Little or no acknowledgment or reward.</strong> People can feel stress when they do not feel they are being recognized for the work they do. This kind of workplace stress can cause people to become withdrawn, unmotivated, or unfocused on being productive for the organization. This type of behavior can also materialize at home with people experiencing this stress being more irritable, cranky, and moody. At work, these feelings can negatively affect our ability to relate to our coworkers and manager.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Lack of control.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Micromanagement</a><span class="glossdef">The excessive control of work details by a supervisor.</span></span> refers to excessive control of work details by a supervisor. For example, a micromanager might tell an employee specific tasks should be worked on in a given day and give specific instructions on how those tasks should be accomplished. This type of situation can create stress, as the employee feels he or she has little control of their own work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Lack of job security.</strong> In the last quarter of 2011 (October, November, December), 266,971 employees were subjected to mass company layoffs,<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_018">The Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Economic News Release: Mass Layoffs,” accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/mslo.nr0.htm">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/mslo.nr0.htm</a></span> and for obvious reasons, this creates stress upon the workers who had to leave and for those workers who stay. Those workers who have been laid off may experience financial hardship, and the workers who haven’t been laid off may need to perform extra work and can suffer from physiological issues even if their jobs were not eliminated. This phenomenon is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">layoff survivor syndrome</a><span class="glossdef">The physiological issues suffered by people who stay in organizations where people around them are laid off.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_019">JoNel Aleccia, “Guilty and Stressed, Layoff Survivors Suffers, Too,” MSNBC, accessed February 19, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28196734/ns/health-behavior/t/guilty-stressed-layoff-survivors-suffer-too/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28196734/ns/health-behavior/t/guilty-stressed-layoff-survivors-suffer-too/</a></span> Many of the stressors caused by layoffs can include increased workloads, increased anxiety, and lower morale.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Office politics.</strong> Dealing with difficult coworkers or supervisors and different personalities (<a class="xref" href="fwk-122425-ch10#fwk-122425-ch10">Chapter 9 "Handle Conflict and Negotiation"</a>) and communication styles (<a class="xref" href="mclean-ch11#mclean-ch11">Chapter 4 "Communicate Effectively"</a>) can create stress at work. Conflicts, disagreements, and misunderstandings are common in today’s workplace, especially with the use of technology. All of these factors, which we call office politics, can create stress, which results in lost sleep, productivity, and motivation—obviously affecting our ability to relate to others.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Everyday challenges.</strong> Getting caught in traffic or a leaky water heater would be examples of things that cause stress in our personal lives. Luckily, most of us have the abilities to cope with these daily stresses. However, too many of these types of stressors in one day can build up and cause major issues at work or in our personal life.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Personality.</strong> Our individual personalities (<a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "What Is Human Relations?"</a>) can impact our ability to handle stress. Research published by Meyer Freidman in the 1950s<span class="footnote" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-fn03_020">Entrepreneurs Lounge, “Type A Personality Traits versus Type B Personality,” accessed February 20, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://entrepreneurslounge.org/type-a-personality-traits-vs-type-b-personality/">http://entrepreneurslounge.org/type-a-personality-traits-vs-type-b-personality/</a></span> characterized two main personality types, type A and type B.

A Type A Behavior Pattern (TABP) is characterized by impatience, aggressiveness, a sense of time urgency, and the desire to achieve recognition and advancement. People with a type A pattern may have a hyperawareness of time and, as a result, perform tasks quickly. Because of these patterns, the person with TABP may feel constantly rushed as they strive to be constantly competitive, causing stress and related health issues. Type A personalities are not viewed as a fixed trait but rather a set of predispositions that may occur in certain situations only. For example, Amiee may exhibit a type A personality at work but at home may not be as time sensitive and impatient. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Type B personalities</a><span class="glossdef">A personality type characterized as more focused on the here and now and are much more laid back than type A personality.</span></span> are more focused on the here and now and are much more laid back.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Work-life balance.</strong> Everyone must manage multiple roles in their life. The roles of mother or father, boss, employee, spouse, sister, or brother have their own unique demands that can create stress at home and at work. When we have challenges at work, this can affect our roles at home and vice versa. Although many organizations promote a work-life balance and create a culture that allows people to have a “home life,” easy access to send that “one last e-mail” at 9 p.m. for work creates a blurred line between home and work. This creates an even greater need for our emotional intelligence skills (self-awareness and self-management) in that we must be aware of our emotions and handle them when they come—rather than just going about our day and plowing ahead.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Life changes.</strong> There are forty-three life changes that are characterized as creating stress. These life changes are measured on a scale called life change units, created by Thomas H. Holmes and Richard Rahe. The life changes are said to cause stress in one’s personal life. However, personality type and situational factors may affect how much a particular event affects a person. For example, suppose a major life change such as the death of a spouse occurs. This would cause an immense amount of stress, but assume the spouse was very ill for a long period of time. In this situation, the latter could have caused stress as well. So while the scale has value in terms of determining what life changes cause the most stress, it is also important to consider the other factors around the life change, along with a person’s personal coping ability.</li>
