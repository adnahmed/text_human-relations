    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-311293">When you walked into work this morning, you said your normal "good mornings" and everyone cheerfully said good morning back to you but one coworker. This is a coworker you have had problems with for quite some time. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-311460">The problems seem to stem from your two different styles of communication. You like to be quick and to the point, so you find yourself e-mailing a lot. Your coworker, Nanci, prefers to have every conversation in person. You feel that while talking in person is nice, it can also be difficult since everyone has such a hectic schedule. Your workstyle is focused on saving time and using time as wisely as possible. For example, Nanci asked you to give her a client's e-mail address. You copied and pasted it from an earlier e-mail and e-mailed it to Nanci. Nanci got very upset at this and commented about your need to always e-mail things instead of talking in person. You told her it was easier to do it that way, plus it prevented the chance that you would write the address down wrong. Nanci did not accept this response. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-311634">In another example, Nanci stopped by your office to ask about your willingness to help set up for the company holiday party. Nanci starting talking with you about the decorations and you interrupted and told her you would be happy to do so and asked her what time you should be there. Nanci again got upset and told you she had no idea. Her body language showed frustration and you couldn't understand why, as you were only asking a reasonable question about timing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-311802">Finally, you decide to talk with your supervisor about these issues. The supervisor gives you some information that was hard to take but also very valuable in the development of a good communication style. "Andree," she said, "while people in the office really like you, they don't find you very warm. People say that your facial expressions and the fact you don't smile very often makes you difficult to approach. To make matters worse, your one- and two-line e-mail responses are sometimes off-putting."</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-311957">In your defense, you say that you are very busy and often don't have time to answer an e-mail with another line. You also say that you are there to work, not to make friends.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-312107">"Yes, this is true," says your supervisor, "but it is important to establish good relationships, which is something you have not seemed to make an effort to do. Good relationships happen with good communication."</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-160349-312268">As you leave, you understand that you will need to improve on this area. The first thing you do is stop by Nanci's office to hear about the decorations she wanted to tell you about for the company party. You feel this is a good start to creating better communication between her and your other coworkers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_p01">Communication, as you see in our opening scenario, is key to any successful career. While communication is likely discussed in several of your other classes, it should also be addressed in an human relations book, since much of what we do at work is based on effective communication.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_p02">How many times do miscommunications happen on a daily basis, either in your personal life or at your job? The good news is that we can all get better at communication. The first thing we need to do is learn how we can better communicate with others. Then we will want to look at our own communication style and compare that with other styles. Have you ever spoken with someone you just didn’t “get”? It is probably because you have different communication styles. Body language is also a key contributor to communication; in fact, as was suggested in the late 1960s by researcher Albert Mehrabian, body language makes up 93 percent of our communication.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-144510-660132">Mehrabian, A., &amp; Ferris, S. R. (1967). Inference of attitudes from nonverbal communication in two channels, <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consulting Psychology</em> <em class="emphasis">31</em>(3): 248–58.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p01">One of the most important aspects to good communication is emotional intelligence (EI). <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Emotional intelligence</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to know and manage our emotions, motivate ourselves, understand others’ emotions, and manage relationships.</span></span>, as we discussed in <a class="xref" href="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02#portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Achieve Personal Success"</a> is the ability to know and manage our emotions, motivate ourselves, understand others’ emotions, and manage relationships. Without EI, it would be impossible to effectively communicate with people.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Directions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p02">In addition to the communication that occurs within organizations, each of us has our own individual communication style. Many organizations give tests that may indicate their candidate’s preferred style, providing information on the best job fit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p01">As you already know, communication in companies is key to having a successful organization. Of course, learning how to communicate better, as a result, is the cornerstone of a successful career. Likewise, understanding how companies communicate with employees can result in employees who are more loyal and motivated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch04_s00_s00">Those that don’t communicate well, though, see increased turnover, absenteeism, dissatisfied customers, higher product defect rates, lack of focus on business objectives, and lack of innovation.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-144641-009313">Business Performance. (n.d.).

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Four main types of communications occur within a company: upward communication, downward communication, diagonal communication, and horizontal communication. Each type of communication can serve a different purpose in human resources, and many messages may be sent in a variety of ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Upward communication</a><span class="glossdef">When the lower levels of an organization communicate with the upper levels of an organization.</span></span> is when the lower levels of an organization communicate with the upper levels of an organization. Some examples might be an employee satisfaction survey using online survey tools such as SurveyMonkey. These kinds of tools can be used to determine the changes that should occur in a company. Oftentimes human resource departments may develop a survey such as this to find out how satisfied the employees are with things such as benefits. Then the organization can make changes based on the satisfaction level of the employees. Employees might also engage in upward communication in a given work situation. They might tell their manager their plate is full and they can’t take on any new projects. This is considered upward communication, too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Downward communication</a><span class="glossdef">The opposite of upward communication, in that the communication occurs from the upper levels of an organization down to the lower levels of the organization.</span></span> is the opposite of upward communication, in that the communication occurs from the upper levels of an organization down to the lower levels of the organization. A manager explaining how to do a task to an employee would be considered downward communication. Development of training programs to communicate safety in the organization might be another example. A change in a pay or bonus structure would be communicated using the downward approach as well.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p05">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diagonal communication</a><span class="glossdef">Interdepartmental communication occurring at various levels of the organization.</span></span> approach occurs when interdepartmental communication occurs with people at different levels of the organization. When the human resources assistant speaks with the marketing manager about the hiring of a new employee in marketing, this would be considered diagonal communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Horizontal communication</a><span class="glossdef">When people at the same level in the organization communicate.</span></span> occurs when people of the same level in an organization—for example, a marketing manager and a human resource manager, communicate usually to coordinate work between departments. An accounting manager might share information with a production manager so the production manager knows how much budget they have left.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p07">Within all the communication methods we discussed, there are a variety of approaches. Of course, the most obvious is the informal communication that occurs. An e-mail may be sent or a phone call made. Meetings are another way to communicate information. Companies can also use more formal means to communicate. A blog would be an example. Many companies use blogs to communicate information such as financial numbers, changes to policy, and other “state of the business” information. This type of information is often downward communication. However, blogs are not just for upper management anymore. Companies are using microblogs more and more to ensure that people in various departments stay connected with each other, especially when tasks tend to be very interdependent.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p08">Companies also use social networking sites to keep in touch, such as Twitter and Facebook. For example, Alcatel-Lucent, a 77,000-employee telecommunications company in Europe, found that using social media keeps a large number of employees connected and tends to be a low or no-cost method of communicating. Rather than sending e-mail to their employees telling them to expect updates via these methods, the news is spread via word of mouth as most of the employees blog or use Facebook or other social media to communicate. In fact, Alcatel-Lucent has over eight hundred groups in its system, ranging from business related to ones social in nature.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn09_005">Gaudin, S. (n.d.). Alcatel-Lucent gets social with company communication. <em class="emphasis">Computerworld</em>, accessed July 19, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179169/Alcatel_Lucent_gets_social_with_company_communication?taxonomyId=209&amp;pageNumber=3">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9179169/Alcatel_Lucent_gets_social_with_company_communication?taxonomyId=209&amp;page Number=3</a>.</span> Use of this type of technology can result in upward, downward, horizontal, and diagonal communication all at once.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p09">Companies also use intranets to communicate information to their employees. An intranet is an internal website, meaning that others generally cannot log in and see information there. The intranet may include information on pay and vacation time as well as recent happenings, awards, and achievements. No matter how the company chooses to communicate with you, understanding these variety of methods can help make you a better employee. Now that we have discussed communication from the company perspective, we should discuss communication from the personal perspective.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Communication Styles</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p01">In addition to the communication that occurs within organizations, each of us has our own individual communication style. Many organizations give tests that may indicate their candidate’s preferred style, providing information on the best job fit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p02">Our communication styles can determine how well we communicate with others, how well we are understood, and even how well we get along with others. As you can imagine, our personality types and our communication styles are very similar. Keep in mind, though, that no one person is “always” one style. We can change our style depending on the situation. The more we can understand our own dominant communication style and pinpoint the styles of others, the better we can communicate. The styles are expresser, driver, relater, and analytical. Let’s discuss each of these styles next.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p03">People with an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">expresser communication style</a><span class="glossdef">A communication style that is easily excitable and relies heavily on hunches and feelings.</span></span> tend to get excited. They like challenges and rely heavily on hunches and feelings. Depending on the type of business, this can be a downfall as sometimes hard data should be used for decision-making purposes. These people are easily recognized because they don’t like too many facts or boring explanations and tend to be antsy if they feel their time is being wasted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p04">People with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">driver style</a><span class="glossdef">A communication style in which a person likes to have his or her own way and be decisive.</span></span> like to have their own way and tend to be decisive. They have strong viewpoints, which they are not afraid to share with others. They like to take charge in their jobs but also in the way they communicate. Drivers usually get right to the point and not waste time with small talk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p05">People with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relater style</a><span class="glossdef">A communication style by someone who prefers to be warmly regarded and have positive attention.</span></span> like positive attention and want to be regarded warmly. They want others to care about them and treat them well. Because relaters value friendships, a good way to communicate well with them is to create a communication environment where they can feel close to others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p06">People with an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analytical communication style</a><span class="glossdef">A communication style in which a person tends to ask a lot of questions and behave methodically.</span></span> will ask a lot of questions and behave methodically.

Let’s assume an analytical communicator and a relater are beginning a meeting where the purpose is to develop a project timeline. The analytical communicator will be focused on the timeline and not necessarily the rapport building that the relater would be focused on. The conversation might go something like this:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p08">How do these two personality styles walk away from this conversation? First, the relater may feel ignored or rejected, because the analytical communicator didn’t want to discuss weekend details. The analytical communicator may feel annoyed that the relater is wasting time talking about personal things when they have a goal to set a project timeline. These types of small miscommunications in business are what can create low morale, absenteeism, and other workplace issues. Understanding which style we tend to use can be the key in determining how we communicate with others. Here is another, personal example of these communication styles and how a conversation might go:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p09">In this situation, you can see that the expresser is just excited about the trip and brings up the conversation as such. The driver has a tendency to be competitive and wants to win, hence his willingness to get there Thursday before everyone else. The expresser, on the other hand, tried to sell his ideas and didn’t get the feedback he felt he deserved for planning the trip, which made the communication start to go south.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p10">In addition to our communication personalities, people tend to communicate based on one of three styles. First, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">passive communicator</a><span class="glossdef">A communication style in which a person puts the rights of others over his or her own.</span></span> tends to put the rights of others before his or her own. Passive communicators tend to be apologetic or sound tentative when they speak. They do not speak up if they feel like they are being wronged.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p13">Have you heard of a passive-aggressive communicator? This person tends to be passive but later aggressive by perhaps making negative comments about others or making snide or underhanded comments. This person might express his or her negative feelings in an indirect way instead of being direct. For example, you are trying to complete a project for a client and the deadline is three days away. You and your team are working frantically to finish. You ask one of your employees to come in to work on Saturday morning to finish up the loose ends so the project will be ready to present to the client on Monday. Your employee agrees, but when you show up on Monday, the project isn’t ready to present. You find out that this person had plans on Saturday but wasn’t direct with you about this. So the project didn’t get completed, and you had to change the appointment with the client. Later, you also find out that this employee was complaining to everyone else that you had asked her to come in on Saturday. As you can see from this example, passive-aggressive behavior doesn’t benefit anyone. The employee should have been direct and simply said, “I can’t come in on Saturday, but I can come in Sunday or work late Friday night.” Ideally, we want to be assertive communicators, as this shows our own self-esteem but at the same time respects others and isn’t misleading to others, either.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s03_p14">When dealing with someone who exhibits passive-aggressive behavior, it is best to just be direct with them. Tell that person you would rather she be direct than not show up. Oftentimes passive-aggressive people try to play the martyr or the victim. Do not allow such people to press your buttons and get you to feel sorry for them. This gives them control and can allow them to take advantage.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-161840-749583">Besides verbal communication, much of our communication at work may happen in the written form, such as e-mail. When using e-mail as a communication tool, we should consider the four Cs:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s06_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Complete.</strong> We want to make sure that all facts are included in the e-mail. When responding to an e-mail, also make sure all questions have been answered.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Concise.</strong> Try to make e-mails as concise as possible. If your e-mail becomes long, it may be better to have a personal conversation rather than an e-mail to make sure the message gets across in the appropriate way.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Correct.</strong> Be sure to check e-mail, grammar, and spelling. E-mails should always have a greeting, body, and closing.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Clear.</strong> Is your writing easy to understand? Does it flow well?</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s01_s06_l02">
            <li>Make sure the subject line is descriptive.</li>
            <li>Use upper and lower case letters. Using all uppercase would be like shouting your message.</li>
            <li>Do not use the “reply all” function if it isn't necessary.</li>
            <li>Make sure to sign your e-mail.</li>
            <li>Before sending, always reread your message to make sure you are conveying your message clearly.</li>
            <li>Do not send e-mails when you are angry or upset. Use a twenty-four-hour rule before replying to an e-mail that gave you this type of emotional response.</li>
            <li>Try to avoid “text message” writing in e-mails—for example, shortening of words such as LMK (let me know).</li>
            <li>Do not forward jokes.</li>
            <li>Limit your use of emoticons.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Emotional intelligence</em> can be improved over time, unlike IQ, which stays stable throughout life.</li>

                <li>There are four types of communication at work: <em class="emphasis">downward</em>, <em class="emphasis">upward</em>, <em class="emphasis">horizontal</em>, and <em class="emphasis">diagonal</em>.

                <li>Companies that use good communication tend to have less turnover and less absenteeism.</li>
                <li>There are four main types of communication styles: <em class="emphasis">expresser</em>, <em class="emphasis">driver</em>, <em class="emphasis">relater</em>, and <em class="emphasis">analytical</em>. The better we can understand our own style of communication and the communication styles of others, the easier it will be to communicate with them.</li>
                <li>Passive, aggressive, and passive-aggressive behaviors are not healthy ways of communicating. Assertive behavior, on the other hand, respects one’s own rights and the rights of others.</li>

<em class="emphasis">Nonverbal communication</em> is one of the most important tools we can use to communicate how we feel. Watching others’ body language can give us signals as to how they may really feel.</li>
                <li>Listening is also an important part of communication. <em class="emphasis">Active listening</em> occurs when we are interested in what the other person has to say, and we check with the speaker to make sure we understand what they have said. <em class="emphasis">Competitive or combative listening</em> is when we are focused on sharing our own point of view. <em class="emphasis">Passive listening</em> is when we listen to someone but do not verify that we understand what someone is saying.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s99_p02">How do you know when your boss or instructors are pleased with your progress (or not)? You might know from the smiles on their faces; from the time and attention they give you; or perhaps in other nonverbal ways, like a raise, a bonus, or a good grade. Whether the interaction takes place face-to-face or at a distance you can still experience and interpret nonverbal responses.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s99_p03">Sometimes we place more emphasis on nonverbal aspects of communication that they warrant. Suppose you have just gotten home from your first date with Amanda and you feel it went very well. How soon should afterward should you call Amanda? There are lots of advice columns, informal rules and customs, and friends with opinions to offer you suggestions, but you know what is right for you. You also know that texting her at five o’clock the next morning might be a bit early. You may choose to wait until a coffee break around 10 a.m. to send a short text message and realize that you might not get a response until later that afternoon.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s99_p04">Does the lack of an immediate response have any meaning? Does it mean Amanda is less interested in you than you are in her? While you might give it more attention than it deserves, and maybe let it weigh on your mind and distract you from other tasks, the time interval for responding may not have as much intentional meaning as you think. It might mean that Amanda has a different sense of time urgency than you do or that she simply didn’t receive your message until later.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s99_p05">Timing is an important aspect of nonverbal communication, but trying to understand what a single example of timing means is challenging. Context may make a difference. For example, if you have known someone for years who has always responded promptly to your e-mails or texts, but now that person hasn’t responded in over a day, you may have reason for concern. That person’s behavior doesn’t match what you are familiar with, and this sudden, unexplained change in the established pattern may mean that you need to follow up.</p>

            <p class="para">What are each of these images telling us?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Chances are you have had many experiences where words were misunderstood or where the meaning of words was unclear. When it comes to nonverbal communication, meaning is even harder to discern. We can sometimes tell what people are communicating through their nonverbal communication, but there is no foolproof “dictionary” of how to interpret nonverbal messages. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonverbal communication</a><span class="glossdef">The process of conveying a message without the use of words.</span></span> is the process of conveying a message without the use of words. It can include gestures and facial expressions, tone of voice, timing, posture, and where you stand as you communicate. It can help or hinder the clear understanding of your message, but it doesn’t reveal (and can even mask) what you are really thinking. Nonverbal communication is far from simple, and its complexity makes our study and our understanding a worthy but challenging goal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Where does a wink start and a nod end? Nonverbal communication involves the entire body, the space it occupies and dominates, the time it interacts, and not only what is not said, but how it is not said. Try to focus on just one element of nonverbal communication and it will soon get lost among all the other stimuli. Let’s consider eye contact. What does it mean by itself without context, chin position, or eyebrows to flag interest or signal a threat? Nonverbal action flows almost seamlessly from one to the next, making it a challenge to interpret one element or even a series of elements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s01_p03">We perceive time as linear, flowing along in a straight line. We did one task, we’re doing another task now, and we are planning on doing something else all the time. Sometimes we place more emphasis on the future, or the past, forgetting that we are actually living in the present moment whether we focus on “the now” or not. Nonverbal communication is always in motion, as long as we are, and is never the same twice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s01_p04">Nonverbal communication is irreversible. In written communication, you can write a clarification, correction, or retraction. While it never makes the original statement go completely away, it does allow for correction. Unlike written communication, oral communication may allow “do-overs” on the spot: you can explain and restate, hoping to clarify your point. You can also dig the hole you are in just a little bit deeper. The old sayings “When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging” and “Open mouth, insert foot” can sometimes apply to oral communications. We’ve all said something we would give anything to take back, but we all know we can’t. Oral communication, like written communication, allows for some correction, but it still doesn’t erase the original message or its impact. Nonverbal communication takes it one step further. You can’t separate one nonverbal action from the context of all the other verbal and nonverbal communication acts, and you can’t take it back.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s01_p05">In a speech, nonverbal communication is continuous in the sense that it is always occurring, and because it is so fluid, it can be hard to determine where one nonverbal message starts and another stops. Words can be easily identified and isolated, but if we try to single out a speaker’s gestures, smile, or stance without looking at how they all come together in context, we may miss the point and draw the wrong conclusion. You need to be conscious of this aspect of your nonverbal behavior, to quote another old saying, “actions speak louder than words.” This is true in the sense that people often pay more attention to your nonverbal expressions more than your words. As a result, nonverbal communication is a powerful way to contribute to (or detract from) your success in communicating your message to others.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication Is Fast</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Let’s pretend you are at your computer at work. You see that an e-mail has arrived, but you are right in the middle of tallying a spreadsheet whose numbers just don’t add up. You see that the e-mail is from a coworker and you click on it. The subject line reads “pink slips.” You could interpret this to mean a suggestion for a Halloween costume or a challenge to race for each other’s car ownership, but in the context of the workplace you may assume it means layoffs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s02_p02">Your emotional response is immediate. If the author of the e-mail could see your face, they would know that your response was one of disbelief and frustration, even anger, all via your nonverbal communication. In the same way, you express yourself via nonverbal communication all the time without much conscious thought at all. You may think about how to share the news with your partner and try to display a smile and a sense of calm when you feel like anything but smiling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s02_p03">Nonverbal communication gives our thoughts and feelings away before we are even aware of what we are thinking or how we feel. People may see and hear more than you ever anticipated. Your nonverbal communication includes both intentional and unintentional messages, but since it all happens so fast, the unintentional ones can contradict what you know you are supposed to say or how you are supposed to react.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication Can Add to or Replace Verbal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p01">People tend to pay more attention to how you say it than what you actually say. In presenting a speech this is particularly true. We communicate nonverbally more than we engage in verbal communication and often use nonverbal expressions to add to, or even replace, words we might otherwise say. We use a nonverbal gesture called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">illustrator</a><span class="glossdef">Nonverbal expression that reinforces a verbal message.</span></span> to communicate our message effectively and reinforce our point. Your coworker Andrew may ask you, “Barney’s Bar after work?” as he walks by, and you simply nod and say “yeah.” Andrew may respond with a nonverbal gesture, called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emblem</a><span class="glossdef">Nonverbal gesture that carries a specific meaning and can replace or reinforce words.</span></span>, by signaling with the “OK” sign as he walks away.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p02">In addition to illustrators or emblematic nonverbal communication, we also use regulators. “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Regulators</a><span class="glossdef">Nonverbal expression that controls, encourages, or discourages interaction.</span></span> are nonverbal messages which control, maintain or discourage interaction.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_001">McLean, S. (2003). <em class="emphasis">The basics of speech communication</em>. Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> For example, if someone is telling you a message that is confusing or upsetting, you may hold up your hand, a commonly recognized regulator that asks the speaker to stop talking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p03">Let’s say you are in a meeting presenting a speech that introduces your company’s latest product. If your audience members nod their heads in agreement on important points and maintain good eye contact, it is a good sign. Nonverbally, they are using regulators encouraging you to continue with your presentation. In contrast, if they look away, tap their feet, and begin drawing in the margins of their notebook, these are regulators suggesting that you better think of a way to regain their interest or else wrap up your presentation quickly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p04">“<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Affect displays</a><span class="glossdef">An expression of emotion or mood.</span></span> are nonverbal communication that express emotions or feelings.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_002">McLean, S. (2003). <em class="emphasis">The basics of speech communication</em> (p. 77). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> An affect display that might accompany holding up your hand for silence would be to frown and shake your head from side to side. When you and Andrew are at Barney’s Bar, smiling and waving at coworkers who arrive lets them know where you are seated and welcomes them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p05">“<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Adaptors</a><span class="glossdef">Something that helps us feel comfortable or indicates emotions or moods.</span></span> are displays of nonverbal communication that help you adapt to your environment and each context, helping you feel comfortable and secure.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_003">McLean, S. (2003). <em class="emphasis">The basics of speech communication</em> (p. 77). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-adaptor</a><span class="glossdef">Adapting something about yourself in way for which it was not designed or for no apparent purpose.</span></span> involves you meeting your need for security (e.g., playing with your hair) by adapting something about yourself in way for which it was not designed or for no apparent purpose. Combing your hair would be an example of a purposeful action, unlike a self-adaptive behavior. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">object-adaptor</a><span class="glossdef">Use of an object for a purpose other than its intended design.</span></span> involves the use of an object in a way for which it was not designed. You may see audience members tapping, chewing, or playing with their pencils while ignoring you and your presentation. Or perhaps someone pulls out a comb and repeatedly rubs a thumbnail against the comb’s teeth. They are using the comb or the pencil in a way other than its intended design, an object-adaptor that communicates a lack of engagement or enthusiasm in your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s03_p06">Intentional nonverbal communication can complement, repeat, replace, mask, or contradict what we say. When Andrew invited you to Barney’s, you said, “Yeah” and nodded, complementing and repeating the message. You could have simply nodded, effectively replacing the “yes” with a nonverbal response. You could also have decided to say no but did not want to hurt Andrew’s feelings. Shaking your head “no” while pointing to your watch, communicating work and time issues, may mask your real thoughts or feelings. Masking involves the substitution of appropriate nonverbal communication for nonverbal communication you may want to display.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_004">McLean, S. (2003). <em class="emphasis">The basics of speech communication</em> (p. 77). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Finally, nonverbal messages that conflict with verbal communication can confuse the listener. <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch11_s01_s03_t01">Table 4.3 "Some Nonverbal Expressions"</a> summarizes these concepts.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication Is Universal</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s04_p01">Consider the many contexts in which interaction occurs during your day. In the morning, at work, after work, at home, with friends, with family, and our list could go on for quite a while. Now consider the differences in nonverbal communication across these many contexts. When you are at work, do you jump up and down and say whatever you want? Why or why not? You may not engage in that behavior because of expectations at work, but the fact remains that from the moment you wake until you sleep, you are surrounded by nonverbal communication.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s04_p02">If you had been born in a different country, to different parents, and perhaps as a member of the opposite sex, your whole world would be quite different. Yet nonverbal communication would remain a universal constant. It may not look the same, or get used in the same way, but it will still be nonverbal communication in its many functions and displays.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication Is Confusing and Contextual</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s05_p01">Nonverbal communication can be confusing. We need contextual clues to help us understand, or begin to understand, what a movement, gesture, or lack of display means. Then we have to figure it all out based on our prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the person and hope to get it right. Talk about a challenge. Nonverbal communication is everywhere, and we all use it, but that doesn’t make it simple or independent of when, where, why, or how we communicate.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nonverbal Communication Can Be Intentional or Unintentional</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s06_p01">Suppose you are working as a salesclerk in a retail store, and a customer communicated frustration to you. Would the nonverbal aspects of your response be intentional or unintentional? Your job is to be pleasant and courteous at all times, yet your wrinkled eyebrows or wide eyes may have been unintentional. They clearly communicate your negative feelings at that moment. Restating your wish to be helpful and displaying nonverbal gestures may communicate “no big deal,” but the stress of the moment is still “written” on your face.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s06_p02">Can we tell when people are intentionally or unintentionally communicating nonverbally? Ask ten people this question and compare their responses. You may be surprised. It is clearly a challenge to understand nonverbal communication in action. We often assign intentional motives to nonverbal communication when in fact their display is unintentional and often hard to interpret.</p>

One is that you often react faster than you think. Your nonverbal responses communicate your initial reaction before you can process it through language or formulate an appropriate response. If your appropriate, spoken response doesn’t match your nonverbal reaction, you may give away your true feelings and attitudes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_005">Beebe, S.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s07_p02">Albert Mehrabian asserts that we rarely communicate emotional messages through the spoken word. According to Mehrabian, 93 percent of the time we communicate our emotions nonverbally, with at least 55 percent associated with facial gestures. Vocal cues, body position and movement, and normative space between speaker and receiver can also be clues to feelings and attitudes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_006">Mehrabian, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s07_p03">Is your first emotional response always an accurate and true representation of your feelings and attitudes, or does your emotional response change across time? We are all changing all the time, and sometimes a moment of frustration or a flash of anger can signal to the receiver a feeling or emotion that existed for a moment but has since passed. Their response to your communication will be based on that perception, even though you might already be over the issue. This is where the spoken word serves us well. You may need to articulate clearly that you were frustrated, but not anymore. The words spoken out loud can serve to clarify and invite additional discussion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s01_s08_p01">Building on the example of responding to a situation with facial gestures associated with frustration before you even have time to think of an appropriate verbal response, let’s ask the question, what would you believe, someone’s actions or their words? According to William Seiler and Melissa Beall, most people tend to believe the nonverbal message over the verbal message. People will often answer that “actions speak louder than words” and place a disproportionate emphasis on the nonverbal response.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias-7621-20120415-150812-589983">Seiler, W., &amp; Beall, M.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_p01">Now that we have discussed the general principles that apply to nonverbal communication, let’s examine eight types of nonverbal communication to further understand this challenging aspect of communication:</p>

    </ol>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Space</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p01">When we discuss space in a nonverbal context, we mean the space between objects and people. Space is often associated with social rank and is an important part of business communication. Who gets the corner office? Why is the head of the table important and who gets to sit there?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p02">People from diverse cultures may have different normative space expectations. If you are from a large urban area, having people stand close to you may be normal. If you are from a rural area or a culture where people expect more space, someone may be standing “too close” for comfort and not know it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p03">Edward T. Hall, serving in the European and South Pacific Regions in the Corps of Engineers during World War II, traveled around the globe. As he moved from one place to another, he noticed that people in different countries kept different distances from each other. In France, they stood closer to each other than they did in England. Hall wondered why that was and began to study what he called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">proxemics</a><span class="glossdef">The study of the human use of space and distance in communication.</span></span>, or the study of the human use of space and distance in communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_009">Hall, E. T. (1963). Proxemics: The study of man’s spacial relations and boundaries. In I. Galdston (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Man’s image in medicine and anthropology</em> (pp. 422–45). New York, NY: International Universities Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p04">In <em class="emphasis">The Hidden Dimension</em>, he indicated there are two main aspects of space: territory and personal space. Hall drew on anthropology to address the concepts of dominance and submission and noted that the more powerful person often claims more space. This plays an important role in modern society, from who gets the corner office to how we negotiate space between vehicles. Road rage is increasingly common where overcrowding occurs, and as more vehicles occupy the same roads, tensions over space are predictable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p05">Territory is related to control. As a way of establishing control over your own room, maybe you painted it your favorite color or put up posters that represent your interests or things you consider unique about yourself. Families or households often mark their space by putting up fences or walls around their houses. This sense of a right to control your space is implicit in territory. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Territory</a><span class="glossdef">The space you claim as your own, are responsible for, or are willing to defend.</span></span> means the space you claim as your own, are responsible for, or are willing to defend.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p06">The second aspect Hall highlights is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal space</a><span class="glossdef">The “bubble” of space surrounding each individual.</span></span>, or the “bubble” of space surrounding each individual. As you walk down a flight of stairs, which side do you choose? We may choose the right side because we’ve learned that is what is expected, and people coming up the same stair choose their right. The right choice insures that personal space is not compromised. But what happens when some comes up the wrong side? They violate the understood rules of movement and often correct themselves. But what happens if they don’t change lanes as people move up and down the stairs? They may get dirty looks or even get bumped as people in the crowd handle the invasion of “their” space. There are no lane markers, and bubbles of space around each person move with them, allowing for the possibility of collision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p07">We recognize the basic need for personal space, but the normative expectations for space vary greatly by culture. You may perceive that in your home people sleep one to each bed, but in many cultures people sleep two or more to a bed and it is considered normal. If you were to share that bed, you might feel uncomfortable, while someone raised with group sleeping norms might feel uncomfortable sleeping alone. From where you stand in an aerobics class in relation to others, to where you place your book bag in class, your personal expectations of space are often at variance with others.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p08">As the context of a staircase has norms for nonverbal behavior, so does the public speaking context. In North America, eye contact with the audience is expected. Big movements and gestures are not generally expected and can be distracting. The speaker occupies a space on the “stage,” even if it’s in front of the class. When you occupy that space, the audience will expect to behave in certain ways. If you talk to the screen behind you while displaying a PowerPoint presentation, the audience may perceive that you are not paying attention to them. Speakers are expected to pay attention to, and interact with, the audience, even if in the feedback is primarily nonverbal. Your movements should coordinate with the tone, rhythm, and content of your speech. Pacing back and forth, keeping your hands in your pockets, or crossing your arms may communicate nervousness, or even defensiveness, and detract from your speech.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s01_p09">As a general rule, try to act naturally, as if you were telling a friend a story, so that your body will relax and your nonverbal gestures will come more naturally. Practice is key to your level of comfort; the more practice you get, the more comfortable and less intimidating it will seem to you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p01">Do you know what time it is? How aware you are of time varies by culture and normative expectations of adherence (or ignorance) of time. Some people, and the communities and cultures they represent, are very time-oriented. The Euro Railways trains in Germany are famous for departing and arriving according to the schedule. In contrast, if you take the train in Argentina, you’ll find that the schedule is more of an approximation of when the train will leave or arrive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p02">“Time is money” is a common saying across many cultures and reveals a high value for time. In social contexts, it often reveals social status and power. Who are you willing to wait for? A doctor for an office visit when you are sick? A potential employer for a job interview? Your significant other or children? Sometimes we get impatient, and our impatience underscores our value for time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p03">When you give a presentation, does your audience have to wait for you? Time is a relevant factor of the communication process in your speech. The best way to show your audience respect is to honor the time expectation associated with your speech. Always try to stop speaking before the audience stops listening; if the audience perceives that you have “gone over time,” they will be less willing to listen. This in turn will have a negative impact on your ability to communicate your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p04">Suppose you are presenting a speech that has three main points. Your audience expects you to regulate the time and attention to each point, but if you spend all your time on the first two points and rush through the third, your speech won’t be balanced and will lose rhythm. The speaker occupies a position of some power, but it is the audience that gives them that position. By displaying respect and maintaining balance, you will move through your points more effectively.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p06">When you order a meal at a fast food restaurant, what are your expectations for how long you will have to wait? When you order a pizza online for delivery, when do you expect it will arrive? If you order cable service for your home, when do you expect it might be delivered? In the first case, you might measure the delivery of a hamburger in a matter of seconds or minutes, and perhaps thirty minutes for pizza delivery, but you may measure the time from your order to working cable in days or even weeks. You may even have to be at your home from 8 a.m. to noon, waiting for its installation. The expectations vary by context, and we often grow frustrated in a time-sensitive culture when the delivery does not match our expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p07">In the same way, how long should it take to respond to a customer’s request for assistance or information? If they call on the phone, how long should they be on hold? How soon should they expect a response to an e-mail? As a skilled business communicator, you will know to anticipate normative expectations and do your best to meet those expectations more quickly than anticipated. Your prompt reply or offer of help in response to a request, even if you cannot solve the issue on the spot, is often regarded positively, contributing to the formation of positive communication interactions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s02_p08">Across cultures the value of time may vary. Some Mexican American friends may invite you to a barbecue at 8 p.m., but when you arrive you are the first guest, because it is understood that the gathering actually doesn’t start until after 9 p.m. Similarly in France, an 8 p.m. party invitation would be understood to indicate you should arrive around 8:30, but in Sweden 8 p.m. means 8 p.m., and latecomers may not be welcome. Some Native Americans, particularly elders, speak in well-measured phrases and take long pauses between phrases. They do not hurry their speech or compete for their turn, knowing no one will interrupt them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_015">McLean, S. (1998).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Body Movements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s04_p01">The study of body movements, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">kinesics</a><span class="glossdef">The study of body movements.</span></span>, is key to understanding nonverbal communication. Since your actions will significantly contribute to the effectiveness of your business interactions, let’s examine four distinct body movements that complement, repeat, regulate, or replace your verbal messages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s04_p02">Body movements can complement the verbal message by reinforcing the main idea. For example, you may be providing an orientation presentation to a customer about a software program. As you say, “Click on this tab,” you may also initiate that action. Your verbal and nonverbal messages reinforce each other. You can also reinforce the message by repeating it. If you first say, “Click on the tab,” and then motion with your hand to the right, indicating that the customer should move the cursor arrow with the mouse to the tab, your repetition can help the listener understand the message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s04_p03">In addition to repeating your message, body movements can also regulate conversations. Nodding your head to indicate that you are listening may encourage the customer to continue asking questions. Holding your hand up, palm out, may signal them to stop and provide a pause where you can start to answer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s04_p04">Body movements also substitute or replace verbal messages. Ekman and Friesen found that facial features communicate to others our feelings, but our body movements often reveal how intensely we experience those feelings.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_020">Ekman, P., &amp; Friesen, W. (1967). Head and body cures in the judgment of emotions: A reformulation. <em class="emphasis">Perceptual and Motor Skills, 24</em>, 711–24.</span> For example, if the customer makes a face of frustration while trying to use the software program, they may need assistance. If they push away from the computer and separate themselves physically from interacting with it, they may be extremely frustrated. Learning to gauge feelings and their intensity as expressed by customers takes time and patience, and your attention to them will improve your ability to facilitate positive interactions.</p>

The meaning itself may be hard to understand or decipher, but it is there nonetheless. For example, your coworker Jan comes back from a sales meeting speechless and with a ghost-white complexion. You may ask if the meeting went all right. “Well, ahh…” may be the only response you get. The pause speaks volumes. Something happened, though you may not know what. It could be personal if Jan’s report was not well received, or it could be more systemic, like the news that sales figures are off by 40 percent and pink slips may not be far behind.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s06_p03">Silence or vocal pauses can communicate hesitation, indicate the need to gather thought, or serve as a sign of respect.

            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s07_p04">How many times do we hear “we didn’t communicate” or “it was a miscommunication”? Even though we are all aware of the importance communication plays in our work-life, somehow these types of issues still happen. <strong class="emphasis bold">Communication applies to human relations in that communication is really the only means we have of expressing ourselves to others.</strong> In other words, every relationship you have built has relied on communication for it to be successful. Those relationships that may have been unsuccessful could have resulted from not understanding each other’s communication style. <strong class="emphasis bold">As you already know from this chapter, communication relates to relationship management skills as well as social awareness skills, which are part of emotional intelligence.</strong> These are the skills that allow us to communicate with others and handle various personalities and work styles. For example, when your roommate or significant other comes home from work, it doesn’t take but a second or two to see this person has had a bad day. Their facial expressions and the way they talk all point to a challenge at work. Social awareness skills help you understand this, empathize with that person, and bring up bad news—such as the fact rent is due—at a later time. These types of skills, or ability to handle social situations well, is what creates positive communication in our relationships.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mclean-ch11_s02_s07_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">The first step to applying communication skills is to first understand your own style.</strong> Are you direct or indirect?

Understanding (self-awareness emotional intelligence skill) our own style can help us understand our strengths and weaknesses and become better communicators. <strong class="emphasis bold">Every successful relationship—work or personal—relies on good, open, and honest communication.</strong></p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mclean-ch11_s03_l01">
            <li>Demonstrate how to use movement to increase the effectiveness of your presentation.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p01">At some point in your career you will be called upon to give a speech. It may be to an audience of one on a sales floor or to a large audience at a national meeting. You already know you need to make a positive first impression, but do you know how to use movement in your presentation? In this section we’ll examine several strategies for movement and their relative advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p02">Customers and audiences respond well to speakers who are comfortable with themselves. Comfortable doesn’t mean overconfident or cocky, and it doesn’t mean shy or timid. It means that an audience is far more likely to forgive the occasional “umm” or “ahh,” or the nonverbal equivalent of a misstep, if the speaker is comfortable with themselves and their message.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p03">Let’s start with behaviors to avoid. Who would you rather listen to, a speaker who moves confidently across the stage or one who hides behind the podium; one who expresses herself nonverbally with purpose and meaning or one who crosses his arms or clings to the lectern?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p04">Audiences are most likely to respond positively to open, dynamic speakers who convey the feeling of being at ease with their bodies. The setting, combined with audience expectations, will give a range of movement. If you are speaking at a formal event, or if you are being covered by a stationary camera, you may be expected to stay in one spot. If the stage allows you to explore, closing the distance between yourself and your audience may prove effective. Rather than focus on a list of behaviors and their relationship to environment and context, give emphasis to what your audience expects and what you yourself would find more engaging instead.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p05">Novice speakers are often told to keep their arms at their sides or to restrict their movement to only that which is absolutely necessary. If you are in formal training for a military presentation or a forensics (speech and debate) competition, this may hold true. But in business and industry, “whatever works” rules the day. You can’t say that expressive gestures—common among many cultural groups, like arm movement while speaking—are not appropriate when they are, in fact, expected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p06">The questions are, again, what does your audience consider appropriate and what do you feel comfortable doing during your presentation? Since the emphasis is always on meeting the needs of the customer, whether it is an audience of one on a sales floor or a large national gathering, you may need to stretch outside your comfort zone. On that same note, don’t stretch too far and move yourself into the uncomfortable range. Finding balance is a challenge, but no one ever said giving a speech was easy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_p07">Movement is an important aspect of your speech and requires planning, the same as the words you choose and the visual aids you design. Be natural, but do not naturally shuffle your feet, pace back and forth, or rock on your heels through your entire speech. These behaviors distract your audience from your message and can communicate nervousness, undermining your credibility.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Positions on the Stage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s01_p01">In a classical speech presentation, positions on the stage serve to guide both the speaker and the audience through transitions. The speaker’s triangle (see <a class="xref" href="#mclean-ch11_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.6 "Speaker’s Triangle"</a>) indicates where the speaker starts in the introduction, moves to the second position for the first point, across for the second point, then returns to the original position to make the third point and conclusion. This movement technique can be quite effective to help you remember each of your main points. It allows you to break down your speech into manageable parts, and putting tape on the floor to indicate position is a common presentation trick. Your movement will demonstrate purpose and reinforce your credibility.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Gestures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02_p01">Gestures involve using your arms and hands while communicating. Gestures provide a way to channel your nervous energy into a positive activity that benefits your speech and gives you something to do with your hands. For example, watch people in normal, everyday conversations. They frequently use their hands to express themselves. Do you think <em class="emphasis">they</em> think about how they use their hands? Most people do not. Their arm and hand gestures come naturally as part of their expression, often reflecting what they have learned within their community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02_p02">For professional speakers this is also true, but deliberate movement can reinforce, repeat, and even regulate an audience’s response to their verbal and nonverbal messages. You want to come across as comfortable and natural, and your use of your arms and hands contributes to your presentation. We can easily recognize that a well-chosen gesture can help make a point memorable or lead the audience to the next point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02_p03">As professional speakers lead up to a main point, they raise their hand slightly, perhaps waist high, often called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anticipation step</a><span class="glossdef">Raising the hand slightly to signal a nonverbal foreshadowing.</span></span>. The gesture clearly shows the audience your anticipation of an upcoming point, serving as a nonverbal form of foreshadowing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02_p04">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">implementation step</a><span class="glossdef">Holding one hand at waist level pointing outward and raising it up with your palm forward, as in the “stop” gesture.</span></span>, which comes next, involves using your arms and hands above your waist. By holding one hand at waist level pointing outward and raising it up with your palm forward, as in the “stop” gesture, you signal the point. The nonverbal gesture complements the spoken word, and as students of speech have noted across time, audiences respond to this nonverbal reinforcement. You then slowly lower your hand down past your waistline and away from your body, letting go of the gesture and signaling your transition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s02_p05">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relaxation step</a><span class="glossdef">Lowering your hand past your waistline and away from your body.</span></span>, where the letting go motion complements your residual message, concludes the motion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s03_p01">As you progress as a speaker from gestures and movement, you will need to turn your attention to facial gestures and expressions. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Facial gestures</a><span class="glossdef">Using your face to display feelings and attitudes nonverbally.</span></span> involve using your face to display feelings and attitudes nonverbally. They may reinforce, or contradict, the spoken word, and their impact cannot be underestimated. As we have discussed, people often focus more on how we say something than what we actually say and place more importance on our nonverbal gestures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_025">Mehrabian, A. (1981). <em class="emphasis">Silent messages: Implicit communication of emotions and attitudes</em> (2nd ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span> As in other body movements, your facial gestures should come naturally, but giving them due thought and consideration can keep you aware of how you are communicating the nonverbal message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s03_p02">Facial gestures should reflect the tone and emotion of your verbal communication. If you are using humor in your speech, you will likely smile and wink to complement the amusement expressed in your words. Smiling will be much less appropriate if your presentation involves a serious subject such as cancer or car accidents. Consider how you want your audience to feel in response to your message, and identify the facial gestures you can use to promote those feelings. Then practice in front of a mirror so that the gestures come naturally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s03_p03">The single most important facial gesture (in mainstream US culture) is eye contact.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mclean-fn11_026">Seiler, W., &amp; Beall, M. (2000). <em class="emphasis">Communication: Making connections</em> (4th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Eye contact</a><span class="glossdef">The speaker’s gaze that engages the audience members.</span></span> refers to the speaker’s gaze that engages the audience members. It can vary in degree and length and, in many cases, is culturally influenced. Both in the speaker’s expectations and the audience member’s notion of what is appropriate will influence normative expectations for eye contact. In some cultures, there are understood behavioral expectations for male gaze directed toward females, and vice versa. In a similar way, children may have expectations of when to look their elders in the eye, and when to gaze down. Depending on the culture, both may be nonverbal signals of listening. Understanding your audience is critical when it comes to nonverbal expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mclean-ch11_s03_s03_p04">When giving a presentation, avoid looking over people’s heads, staring at a point on the wall, or letting your eyes dart all over the place. The audience will find these mannerisms unnerving. They will not feel as connected, or receptive, to your message, and you will reduce your effectiveness. Move your eyes gradually and naturally across the audience, both close to you and toward the back of the room. Try to look for faces that look interested and engaged in your message. Do not to focus on only one or two audience members, as audiences may respond negatively to perceived favoritism. Instead, try to give as much eye contact as possible across the audience. Keep it natural, but give it deliberate thought.</p>
