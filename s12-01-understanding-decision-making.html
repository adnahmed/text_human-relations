This chapter will help you understand how to make decisions alone or in a group while avoiding common decision-making pitfalls. As you know, the key to positive human relations in these situations is communication and application of emotional intelligence skills such as self-awareness when making decisions alone. Emotional intelligence is required in the form of relationship management when making decisions in groups.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_p02">Individuals throughout organizations use the information they gather to make a wide range of decisions. These decisions may affect the lives of others and change the course of an organization. For example, the decisions made by executives and consulting firms for Enron ultimately resulted in a $60 billion loss for investors, thousands of employees without jobs, and the loss of all employee retirement funds. But Sherron Watkins, a former Enron employee and now-famous whistleblower, uncovered the accounting problems and tried to enact change. Similarly, the decision made by firms to trade in mortgage-backed securities is having negative consequences for the entire economy in the United States. All parties involved in such outcomes made a decision, and everyone is now living with the consequences of those decisions.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Despite the far-reaching nature of the decisions in the previous example, not all decisions have major consequences or even require a lot of thought. For example, before you come to class, you make simple and habitual decisions such as what to wear, what to eat, and which route to take as you go to and from home and school. You probably do not spend much time on these mundane decisions. These types of straightforward decisions are termed <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">programmed decisions</a><span class="glossdef">Decisions that occur frequently enough that we develop an automated response to them.</span></span>, or decisions that occur frequently enough that we develop an automated response to them. The automated response we use to make these decisions is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decision rule</a><span class="glossdef">Automated response to problems that occur routinely.</span></span>. For example, many restaurants face customer complaints as a routine part of doing business. Because complaints are a recurring problem, responding to them may become a programmed decision. The restaurant might enact a policy stating that every time they receive a valid customer complaint, the customer should receive a free dessert, which represents a decision rule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s01_p03">On the other hand, unique and important decisions require conscious thinking, information gathering, and careful consideration of alternatives. These are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonprogrammed decisions</a><span class="glossdef">Unique, nonroutine, and important. These decisions require conscious thinking, information gathering, and careful consideration of alternatives.</span></span>. For example, in 2005 McDonald’s Corporation became aware of the need to respond to growing customer concerns regarding the unhealthy aspects (high in fat and calories) of the food they sell. This is a nonprogrammed decision, because for several decades, customers of fast-food restaurants were more concerned with the taste and price of the food rather than its healthiness. In response to this problem, McDonald’s decided to offer healthier alternatives such as the choice to substitute French fries in Happy Meals with apple slices, and in 2007 they banned the use of trans fat at their restaurants.</p>

            <p class="para">In order to ensure consistency around the globe such as at this St. Petersburg, Russia, location, McDonald’s Corporation trains all restaurant managers at Hamburger University, where they take the equivalent of two years of college courses and learn how to make decisions on the job.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s01_p04">A crisis situation also constitutes a nonprogrammed decision for companies. For example, the leadership of Nutrorim was facing a tough decision. They had recently introduced a new product, ChargeUp with Lipitrene, an improved version of their popular sports drink powder, ChargeUp. At some point, a phone call came from a state health department to inform them of eleven cases of gastrointestinal distress that might be related to their product, which led to a decision to recall ChargeUp. The decision was made without an investigation of the information. While this decision was conservative, it was made without a process that weighed the information. Two weeks later it became clear that the reported health problems were unrelated to Nutrorim’s product. In fact, all the cases were traced back to a contaminated health club juice bar. However, the damage to the brand and to the balance sheets was already done. This unfortunate decision caused Nutrorim to rethink the way decisions were made when under pressure. The company now gathers information to make informed choices even when time is of the essence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_002">Garvin, D. A. (2006, January).

The manager of the restaurant implemented the free dessert policy as a way to handle customer complaints, which is a tactical decision. Finally, the servers at the restaurant are making individual decisions each day by evaluating whether each customer complaint received is legitimate and warrants a free dessert.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s01_p06">In this chapter we are going to discuss different decision-making models designed to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of nonprogrammed decisions. We will cover four decision-making approaches, starting with the rational decision-making model, moving to the bounded rationality decision-making model, the intuitive decision-making model, and ending with the creative decision-making model. The importance of making good decisions relates to our ability to manage our emotional intelligence to make sure we make the right decisions. These models will help us make better decisions, which results in better human relations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Rational Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rational decision-making model</a><span class="glossdef">A series of steps that decision makers should consider if their goal is to maximize their outcome and make the best choice.</span></span> describes a series of steps that decision makers should consider if their goal is to maximize the quality of their outcomes. In other words, if you want to make sure that you make the best choice, going through the formal steps of the rational decision-making model may make sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p02">Let’s imagine that your old, clunky car has broken down, and you have enough money saved for a substantial down payment on a new car. It will be the first major purchase of your life, and you want to make the right choice. The first step, therefore, has already been completed—we know that you want to buy a new car. Next, in step 2, you’ll need to decide which factors are important to you. How many passengers do you want to accommodate? How important is fuel economy to you? Is safety a major concern? You only have a certain amount of money saved, and you don’t want to take on too much debt, so price range is an important factor as well. If you know you want to have room for at least five adults, get at least twenty miles per gallon, drive a car with a strong safety rating, not spend more than $22,000 on the purchase, and like how it looks, you have identified the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decision criteria</a><span class="glossdef">A set of parameters against which all of the potential options in decision making will be evaluated.</span></span>. All the potential options for purchasing your car will be evaluated against these criteria. Before we can move too much further, you need to decide how important each factor is to your decision in step 3. If each is equally important, then there is no need to weigh them, but if you know that price and mpg are key factors, you might weigh them heavily and keep the other criteria with medium importance. Step 4 requires you to generate all <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">alternatives</a><span class="glossdef">Other possible solutions to a problem in a decision-making process.</span></span> about your options. Then, in step 5, you need to use this information to evaluate each alternative against the criteria you have established. You choose the best alternative (step 6), and then you would go out and buy your new car (step 7).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p03">Of course, the outcome of this decision will influence the next decision made. That is where step 8 comes in. For example, if you purchase a car and have nothing but problems with it, you will be less likely to consider the same make and model when purchasing a car the next time.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p04">While decision makers can get off track during any of these steps, research shows that searching for alternatives in the fourth step can be the most challenging and often leads to failure. In fact, one researcher found that no alternative generation occurred in 85 percent of the decisions he studied.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_003">Nutt, P. C. (1994). Types of organizational decision processes. <em class="emphasis">Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, <em class="emphasis">29</em>, 414–550.</span> Conversely, successful managers know what they want at the outset of the decision-making process, set objectives for others to respond to, carry out an unrestricted search for solutions, get key people to participate, and avoid using their power to push their perspective.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_004">Nutt, P. C. (1998). Surprising but true: Half the decisions in organizations fail. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 75–90.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p05">The rational decision-making model has important lessons for decision makers. First, when making a decision, you may want to make sure that you establish your decision criteria before you search for alternatives. This would prevent you from liking one option too much and setting your criteria accordingly. For example, let’s say you started browsing cars online before you generated your decision criteria. You may come across a car that you feel reflects your sense of style and you develop an emotional bond with the car. Then, because of your love for the particular car, you may say to yourself that the fuel economy of the car and the innovative braking system are the most important criteria. After purchasing it, you may realize that the car is too small for your friends to ride in the back seat, which was something you should have thought about. Setting criteria before you search for alternatives may prevent you from making such mistakes. Another advantage of the rational model is that it urges decision makers to generate all alternatives instead of only a few. By generating a large number of alternatives that cover a wide range of possibilities, you are unlikely to make a more effective decision that does not require sacrificing one criterion for the sake of another.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p06">Despite all its benefits, you may have noticed that this decision-making model involves a number of unrealistic assumptions as well. It assumes that people completely understand the decision to be made, that they know all their available choices, that they have no perceptual biases, and that they want to make optimal decisions. Nobel Prize–winning economist Herbert Simon observed that while the rational decision-making model may be a helpful device in aiding decision makers when working through problems, it doesn’t represent how decisions are frequently made within organizations. In fact, Simon argued that it didn’t even come close.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s02_p07">Think about how you make important decisions in your life. It is likely that you rarely sit down and complete all eight of the steps in the rational decision-making model. For example, this model proposed that we should search for all possible alternatives before making a decision, but that process is time consuming, and individuals are often under time pressure to make decisions. Moreover, even if we had access to all the information that was available, it could be challenging to compare the pros and cons of each alternative and rank them according to our preferences. Anyone who has recently purchased a new laptop computer or cell phone can attest to the challenge of sorting through the different strengths and limitations of each brand and model and arriving at the solution that best meets particular needs. In fact, the availability of too much information can lead to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analysis paralysis</a><span class="glossdef">A decision-making process in which more and more time is spent on gathering information and thinking about it, but no decisions actually get made.</span></span>, in which more and more time is spent on gathering information and thinking about it, but no decisions actually get made. A senior executive at Hewlett-Packard Development Company LP admits that his company suffered from this spiral of analyzing things for too long to the point where data gathering led to “not making decisions, instead of us making decisions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_005">Zell, D. M., Glassman, A. M., &amp; Duron, S. A. (2007). Strategic management in turbulent times: The short and glorious history of accelerated decision making at Hewlett-Packard. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Dynamics</em>, <em class="emphasis">36</em>, 93–104.</span> Moreover, you may not always be interested in reaching an optimal decision. For example, if you are looking to purchase a house, you may be willing and able to invest a great deal of time and energy to find your dream house, but if you are only looking for an apartment to rent for the academic year, you may be willing to take the first one that meets your criteria of being clean, close to campus, and within your price range.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s03_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bounded rationality model</a><span class="glossdef">According to this model, individuals knowingly limit their options to a manageable set and choose the first acceptable alternative without conducting an exhaustive search for alternatives.</span></span> of decision making recognizes the limitations of our decision-making processes. According to this model, individuals knowingly limit their options to a manageable set and choose the first acceptable alternative without conducting an exhaustive search for alternatives. An important part of the bounded rationality approach is the tendency to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">satisfice</a><span class="glossdef">To accept the first alternative that meets minimum criteria.</span></span> (a term coined by Herbert Simon from <em class="emphasis">satisfy</em> and <em class="emphasis">suffice</em>), which refers to accepting the first alternative that meets your minimum criteria. For example, many college graduates do not conduct a national or international search for potential job openings. Instead, they focus their search on a limited geographic area, and they tend to accept the first offer in their chosen area, even if it may not be the ideal job situation. Satisficing is similar to rational decision making. The main difference is that rather than choosing the best option and maximizing the potential outcome, the decision maker saves cognitive time and effort by accepting the first alternative that meets the minimum threshold.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Intuitive Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s04_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intuitive decision-making model</a><span class="glossdef">Arriving at decisions without conscious reasoning.

This model refers to arriving at decisions without conscious reasoning. A total of 89 percent of managers surveyed admitted to using intuition to make decisions at least sometimes and 59 percent said they used intuition often.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_006">Burke, L. A., &amp; Miller, M. K. (1999). Taking the mystery out of intuitive decision making. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Executive</em>, <em class="emphasis">13</em>, 91–98.</span> Managers make decisions under challenging circumstances, including time pressures, constraints, a great deal of uncertainty, changing conditions, and highly visible and high-stakes outcomes. Thus, it makes sense that they would not have the time to use the rational decision-making model. Yet when CEOs, financial analysts, and health care workers are asked about the critical decisions they make, seldom do they attribute success to luck. To an outside observer, it may seem like they are making guesses as to the course of action to take, but it turns out that experts systematically make decisions using a different model than was earlier suspected. Research on life-or-death decisions made by fire chiefs, pilots, and nurses finds that experts do not choose among a list of well thought out alternatives. They don’t decide between two or three options and choose the best one. Instead, they consider only one option at a time. The intuitive decision-making model argues that in a given situation, experts making decisions scan the environment for cues to recognize patterns.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_007">Breen, B. (2000, August). What’s your intuition? <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, 290; Klein, G. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Intuition at work</em>. New York: Doubleday; Salas, E., &amp; Klein, G. (2001). <em class="emphasis">Linking expertise and naturalistic decision making</em>. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</span> Once a pattern is recognized, they can play a potential course of action through to its outcome based on their prior experience. Thanks to training, experience, and knowledge, these decision makers have an idea of how well a given solution may work. If they run through the mental model and find that the solution will not work, they alter the solution before setting it into action. If it still is not deemed a workable solution, it is discarded as an option, and a new idea is tested until a workable solution is found. Once a viable course of action is identified, the decision maker puts the solution into motion. The key point is that only one choice is considered at a time. Novices are not able to make effective decisions this way, because they do not have enough prior experience to draw upon.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Creative Decisions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s05_p01">In addition to the rational decision making, bounded rationality, and intuitive decision-making models, creative decision making is a vital part of being an effective decision maker. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Creativity</a><span class="glossdef">The generation of new ideas that are original, fluent, and flexible.</span></span> is the generation of new, imaginative ideas. With the flattening of organizations and intense competition among companies, individuals and organizations are driven to be creative in decisions ranging from cutting costs to generating new ways of doing business. Please note that, while creativity is the first step in the innovation process, creativity and innovation are not the same thing. Innovation begins with creative ideas, but it also involves realistic planning and follow-through. Innovations such as 3M’s Clearview Window Tinting grow out of a creative decision-making process about what may or may not work to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s01_s05_p02">The five steps to creative decision making are similar to the previous decision-making models in some keys ways. All the models include problem identification, which is the step in which the need for problem solving becomes apparent. If you do not recognize that you have a problem, it is impossible to solve it. Immersion is the step in which the decision maker consciously thinks about the problem and gathers information. A key to success in creative decision making is having or acquiring expertise in the area being studied. Then, incubation occurs. During incubation, the individual sets the problem aside and does not think about it for a while. At this time, the brain is actually working on the problem unconsciously. Then comes illumination, or the insight moment when the solution to the problem becomes apparent to the person, sometimes when it is least expected. This sudden insight is the “eureka” moment, similar to what happened to the ancient Greek inventor Archimedes, who found a solution to the problem he was working on while taking a bath. Finally, the verification and application stage happens when the decision maker consciously verifies the feasibility of the solution and implements the decision.</p>

It was not until he was sitting outside a McDonald’s restaurant with his grandchildren that it dawned on him. The golden arches of the M of the McDonald’s logo inspired his solution—he would design the de-icer as a series of Ms.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_008">Interview conducted by author Talya Bauer at Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA, 1990.</span> This represented the illumination stage.

Soon after starting work at a software company, he invented a successful debugging tool, which led to his founding of the computer troubleshooting company Pure Software LLC in 1991. After a merger and the subsequent sale of the resulting company in 1997, Hastings founded Netflix, which revolutionized the DVD rental business with online rentals delivered through the mail with no late fees. In 2007, Hastings was elected to Microsoft’s board of directors. As you can see, his ideas are high in originality and flexibility.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_009">Conlin, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120417-130824-866218">One example of a creative decision making model is the Edward Debono model. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Edward Debono's model of the Six Thinking Hats</strong> provides us with a different way of thinking about the way we make decisions. The six hats provide us with perspectives from six different perspectives. Similar to the rational decision making model discussed earlier, this model uses hats to represent the steps we need to follow in order to make good decisions. For example, the white hat helps us look at the facts of the situation. The red hat helps us look at the emotional aspect of the problem or solution. The black hat helps us to look at the negatives of the solution, while the yellow hat helps us think about the positives of the solution. The green hat allows us to come up with potential solutions or courses of action, while the blue hat helps us manage the process of making the decision. For example, consider the opening scenario where Andi is considering which job to accept. If she were using the six hats model, first she would look at the facts—that is, the aspects of each job offer (white hat). Then, she would look at how she feel (red hat) about each job. Next, she would look at the downsides of each job (black hat). Then, she would look at the positives of each job (yellow hat). Next, she would use the green hat to look at the job offers from a creative way and look at potential of choosing one job over another. Finally, the blue hat would cause Andi to make sure she used all hats to make a decision and, based on the data, would go ahead and make the best choice.</p>

                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p01">Sometimes when we are faced with making a hard decision, we can be overly emotional and therefore make the wrong one. <strong class="emphasis bold">By developing self-awareness skills (I am feeling xx way) and then managing our emotions once we recognize them, we can learn to make healthy, wise decisions.</strong> As you read about the Debono decision-making model, this model specifically asks that you look at your own emotions and the emotions of others. This is part of self-awareness and social awareness in emotional intelligence. Without these skills, it can be difficult to make good decisions.</p>
                <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">The ability to make good decisions can help us become happier people, thus better at human relations.</strong> When we understand how we feel about a certain decision we have to make, we can look realistically at all possible solutions from a cognitive level, which allows us to also make better decisions. These emotional intelligence skills, specifically self-awareness and self-management, can help us make thoughtful, sound decisions that improve our productivity, happiness, and satisfaction. All these skills are important ingredients to positive human relations at work and in our personal lives.</p>
