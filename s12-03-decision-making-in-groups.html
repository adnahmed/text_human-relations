        <h2 class="title editable block">When It Comes to Decision Making, Are Two Heads Better Than One?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s03_s01_p01">The answer to this question depends on several factors. Group decision making has the advantage of drawing from the experiences and perspectives of a larger number of individuals. Hence, a group may have the potential to be more creative and lead to more effective decisions. In fact, groups may sometimes achieve results beyond what they could have done as individuals. Groups may also make the task more enjoyable for the members. Finally, when the decision is made by a group rather than a single individual, implementation of the decision will be easier, because group members will be more invested in the decision. If the group is diverse, better decisions may be made, because different group members may have different ideas based on their backgrounds and experiences. Research shows that for top management teams, diverse groups that debate issues make decisions that are more comprehensive and better for the bottom line.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_022">Simons, T., Pelled, L. H., &amp; Smith, K. A. (1999). Making use of difference: Diversity, debate, decision comprehensiveness in top management teams. <em class="emphasis">Academy of Management Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">42</em>, 662–73.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s03_s01_p02">Despite its popularity within organizations, group decision making suffers from a number of disadvantages. We know that groups rarely outperform their best member.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_023">Miner, F. C. (1984). Group versus individual decision making: An investigation of performance measures, decision strategies, and process losses/gains. <em class="emphasis">Organizational Behavior and Human Performance</em>, <em class="emphasis">33</em>, 112–24.</span> While groups have the potential to arrive at an effective decision, they often suffer from process losses. For example, groups may suffer from coordination problems. Anyone who has worked with a team of individuals on a project can attest to the difficulty of coordinating members’ work or even coordinating everyone’s presence in a team meeting. Furthermore, groups can suffer from groupthink. Finally, group decision making takes more time compared to individual decision making, because all members need to discuss their thoughts regarding different alternatives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Thus, whether an individual or a group decision is preferable will depend on the specifics of the situation. For example, if there is an emergency and a decision needs to be made quickly, individual decision making might be preferred. Individual decision making may also be appropriate if the individual in question has all the information needed to make the decision and if implementation problems are not expected. On the other hand, if one person does not have all the information and skills needed to make a decision, if implementing the decision will be difficult without the involvement of those who will be affected by the decision, and if time urgency is more modest, then decision making by a group may be more effective.</p>

NGT is not a technique to be used routinely at all meetings. Rather, it is used to structure group meetings when members are grappling with problem solving or idea generation. It follows four steps.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_026">Delbecq, A. L., Van de Ven, A. H., &amp; Gustafson, D. H. (1975). <em class="emphasis">Group techniques for program planning: A guide to nominal group and Delphi processes</em>. Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman.</span> First, each member of the group begins by independently and silently writing down ideas. Second, the group goes in order around the room to gather all the ideas that were generated. This process continues until all the ideas are shared. Third, a discussion takes place around each idea, and members ask for and give clarification and make evaluative statements. Finally, group members vote for their favorite ideas by using ranking or rating techniques. Following the four-step NGT helps to ensure that all members participate fully, and it avoids group decision-making problems such as groupthink.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-122425-ch11_s03_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Delphi Technique</a><span class="glossdef">A group process that utilizes written responses to a series of questionnaires instead of physically bringing individuals together to make a decision.</span></span> is unique because it is a group process using written responses to a series of questionnaires instead of physically bringing individuals together to make a decision. The first questionnaire asks individuals to respond to a broad question such as stating the problem, outlining objectives, or proposing solutions. Each subsequent questionnaire is built from the information gathered in the previous one. The process ends when the group reaches a consensus. Facilitators can decide whether to keep responses anonymous. This process is often used to generate best practices from experts. For example, Purdue University Professor Michael Campion used this process when he was editor of the research journal <em class="emphasis">Personnel Psychology</em> and wanted to determine the qualities that distinguished a good research article. Using the Delphi technique, he was able to gather responses from hundreds of top researchers from around the world and distill them into a checklist of criteria that he could use to evaluate articles submitted to his journal, all without ever having to leave his office.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_027">Campion, M.

This technique has remained popular, perhaps due to its simplicity, speed, ease of use, and representational fairness.

While consensus tends to require more time, it may make sense when support is needed to enact the plan. The process works by discussing the issues at hand, generating a proposal, calling for consensus, and discussing any concerns. If concerns still exist, the proposal is modified to accommodate them. These steps are repeated until consensus is reached. Thus, this decision-making rule is inclusive, participatory, cooperative, and democratic. Research shows that consensus can lead to better accuracy,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_029">Roch, S. G. (2007).

Businesses invested $2.7 billion into new systems in 2002, and projections were for this number to double every five years. As the popularity of these systems grows, they risk becoming counterproductive. Humans can only process so many ideas and information at one time. As virtual meetings grow larger, it is reasonable to assume that information overload can occur and good ideas will fall through the cracks, essentially recreating a problem that the GDSS was intended to solve, which is to make sure every idea is heard. Another problem is the system possibly becoming too complicated. If the systems evolve to a point of uncomfortable complexity, it has recreated the problem. Those who understand the interface will control the narrative of the discussion, while those who are less savvy will only be along for the ride.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-bauer-fn11_034">Nunamaker, J.
