    <div class="section" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Power and Privilege</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">As defined in this chapter, diversity focuses on the “otherness” or differences between individuals and has a goal of making sure, through policies, that everyone is treated the same. While this is the legal and the right thing to do, multiculturalism looks at a system of advantages based on race, gender, and sexual orientation called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">power and privilege</a><span class="glossdef">A system of advantages based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other components of diversity.</span></span>. In this system, the advantages are based on a system in which one race, gender, and sexual orientation is predominant in setting societal rules and norms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">The interesting thing about power and privilege is that if you have it, you may not initially recognize it, which is why we can call it invisible privilege. Recognizing power and privilege can help you begin to understand how you relate to others. This is an important emotional intelligence skill of relationship management. Here are some examples of invisible privilege:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Race privilege.</strong> Let’s say you (a Caucasian) and your friend (an African American) are having dinner together, and when the bill comes, the server gives the check to you. While this may not seem like a big issue, it assumes you (being Caucasian) are the person paying for the meal. This type of invisible privilege may not seem to matter if you have that privilege, but if you don’t, it can be infuriating.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Social class privilege.</strong> When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, many people from outside the storm area wondered why so many people stayed in the city, not even thinking about the fact that some people couldn’t afford the gas to put in their car to leave the city.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Gender privilege.</strong> This refers to privileges one gender has over another—for example, the assumption that a female will change her name to her husband’s when they get married.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sexual orientation privilege.</strong> If I am heterosexual, I can put a picture of my partner on my desk without worrying about what others think. I can talk about our vacations together or experiences we’ve had without worrying what someone might think about my relationship. This is not the case for many gay, lesbian, and transgendered people and their partners.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">Oftentimes the privilege we have is considered invisible, because it can be hard to recognize one’s own privilege based on race, gender, or social class. Many people utilize the color-blind approach, which says, “I treat everyone the same,” or “I don’t see people’s skin color.” In this case, the person is showing invisible privilege and thus ignoring the privileges he or she receives because of race, gender, or social class. While it appears this approach would value all people equally, it doesn’t, because people’s different needs, assets, and perspectives are disregarded by not acknowledging differences.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_003">Victoria C. Plaut, Kecia M. Thomas, and Matt J. Goren, “Is Multiculturalism or Color Blindness Better for Minorities?” <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science</em> 20, no. 4 (2009): 444–46.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Another important aspect of power and privilege is the fact that we may have privilege in one area and not another. For example, I am a Caucasian female, which certainly gives me race privilege but not gender privilege. Important to note here is that the idea of power and privilege is not about “white male bashing” but understanding our own stereotypes and systems of advantage so we can be more inclusive with our coworkers, employees, and managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s01_p05">So what does this all mean in relation to the workplace? It means we can combine the understanding of certain systems that allow for power and privilege, and by understanding we may be able to eliminate or at least minimize these issues. Besides this, one of the best things we can do for our organizations is to have a diverse workforce, with people from a variety of perspectives. This diversity leads to profitability and the ability to better serve customers for the company and better human relations skills for us. We discuss the advantages of diversity in Section 1.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Diversity and Multiculturalism?</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">When many people look at diversity and multiculturalism, they think that someone’s gender, skin color, or social class shouldn’t matter. So diversity can help us with policies to prevent discrimination, while multiculturalism can help us gain a deeper understanding of the differences between people. Hopefully, over time, rather than look at diversity as attaining numerical goals or complying with the law, we can combine the concepts to create better workplaces. Although many books discuss laws relating to diversity, not many actually describe why diversity is necessary in the workplace. Here are a few main reasons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>It is the law.</li>
            <li>We can better serve customers by offering a broader range of services, such as being able to speak a variety of languages and understanding other cultures.</li>
            <li>We can better communicate with one another (saving time and money) and customers.</li>
            <li>With a multicultural perspective, we can create better ideas and solutions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p05">Promoting a multicultural work environment isn’t just the law. Through a diverse work environment and multicultural understanding, organizations can attain greater profitability. A study by Cedric Herring called <em class="emphasis">Does Diversity Pay?</em><span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_006">Cedric Herring, “Does Diversity Pay? Racial Composition of Firms and the Business Case for Diversity” (paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Montreal, Canada, August 11, 2006), accessed May 5, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p101792_index.html">http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p101792_index.html</a>.</span> reveals that diversity does, in fact, pay. The study found those businesses with greater racial diversity reporter higher sales revenues, more customers, larger market shares, and greater relative profits than those with more homogeneous workforces. Other research on the topic by Scott Page, the author of <em class="emphasis">The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies</em><span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_007">Scott E. Page, <em class="emphasis">The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies</em> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007).</span> ended up with similar results. Page found that people from varied backgrounds are more effective at working together than those who are from similar backgrounds, because they offer different approaches and perspectives in the development of solutions. Often people believe that diversity is about checking a box or only providing window dressing to gain more customers, but this isn’t the case. As put by Eric Foss, chairperson and CEO of Pepsi Beverages Company, “It’s not a fad. It’s not an idea of the month. It’s central and it’s linked very directly to business strategy.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_008">William J. Holstein, “Diversity Is Even More Important in Hard Times,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 13, 2009, accessed August 25, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14interview.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/14/business/14interview.html</a>.</span> A study by the late Roy Adler of Pepperdine University shows similar results. His nineteen-year study of 215 <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 companies shows a strong correlation between female executives and high profitability.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_009">Roy Adler, “Women in the Executive Suite Correlate to High Profits,” Glass Ceiling Research Center.</span> Another study, conducted by Project Equality, found that companies that rated low on equal opportunity issues earned 7.9 percent profit, while those who rated highest with more equal opportunities resulted in 18.3 percent profit.<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_010">Melissa Lauber, “Studies Show That Diversity in Workplace Is Profitable,” <em class="emphasis">Project Equality</em>, n.d., accessed July 11, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/diversity.html">http://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/diversity.html</a>.</span> These numbers show that diversity and multiculturalism certainly is not a fad but a way of doing business that better serves customers and results in higher profits for companies, while allowing us to get better at human relations skills. As employees, we need to recognize this so we may begin to understand our own power and privilege, which allows for better communication at work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p07">Perhaps one of the best diversity statements by a <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em> 500 company was made by Jose Manuel Souto, the CFO for Visa in Latin America. He says, “A diverse workforce is critical to providing the best service to our global clients, supporting our business initiatives, and creating a workplace environment that promotes respect and fairness.”<span class="footnote" id="portolesedias_1.0-fn03_011">National Latina Business Women Association, “Women and Minorities on Corporate Boards Still Lags Far Behind National Population,” accessed August 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.voxxi.com/minority-women-lagging/">http://www.voxxi.com/minority-women-lagging/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias-7621-20120405-185119-078654">The first step to being effective at working in a diverse environment is understanding that everyone comes from a different place of power and privilege, and as a result, everyone has a different perspective. Once we understand this, our understanding can translate into better verbal and nonverbal communication. These different perspectives are what makes companies successful, as we have discussed in this section.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_p08">Now that you have an understanding of the meaning of diversity, power, and privilege, as well as the importance of diversity, we will discuss multiculturalism and the law.</p>

Appreciating and understand this diversity is what helps us be successful in our career path. <strong class="emphasis bold">The ability to communicate effectively with a variety of people shows our relationship management and social awareness skills.</strong></p>
            <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">The success in working in diverse environments can come through use of emotional intelligence skills such as relationship management and social awareness.</strong> These skills allow us to understand how another person feels or why they do something, even if we do not agree.

            <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p03">Developing the skills to work in a multicultural environment can help us work with people from any variety of backgrounds and also helps us to communicate better with everyone we may come across, both professionally and personally. <strong class="emphasis bold">These abilities, acceptance and understanding, are cornerstones to developing positive relationships that lead to positive human relations and work success.</strong></p>

<em class="emphasis">Diversity</em> is the real or perceived differences between individuals. This can include race, gender, sexual orientation, size, cultural background, and much more.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Multiculturalism</em> is a term that is similar to diversity, but it focuses on development of a greater understanding of how power in society can be unequal due to race, gender, sexual orientation, power, and privilege.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Power and privilege</em> is a system of advantages based on one’s race, gender, and sexual orientation. This system can often be invisible (to those who have it), which results in one race or gender having unequal power in the workplace. Of course, this unequal power results in unfairness, which may be of legal concern.</li>
                <li>
<em class="emphasis">Diversity</em> is important to the success of organizations. Many studies have shown a direct link between the amount of diversity in a workplace and the company’s success.</li>
