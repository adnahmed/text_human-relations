        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="portolesedias_1.0-ch09_s03_l01">
            <li>Just like in communication, a different management style should be used depending on the employee.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Task styles</em> focus on getting the job done, while <em class="emphasis">people-centered styles</em> focus on relationships.</li>
            <li>A <em class="emphasis">participatory style</em> involves both task-oriented and people-centered styles. A <em class="emphasis">directing style</em> is focused on the task and doesn’t allow for employee participation.</li>
            <li>A teamwork style focuses on teamwork and is a people-oriented style. The advantage of this style is the ability to use strengths from everyone on the team.</li>
            <li>An <em class="emphasis">autocratic style</em> doesn’t allow much room for employee decision making; the focus is on getting the task done. A <em class="emphasis">participative style</em> constantly requires input from employees. The <em class="emphasis">free-rein style</em> gives employees freedom to make decisions on how things will get done.</li>
            <li>The <em class="emphasis">situational leadership model</em>, which looks at relationship behavior, task behavior, and the readiness of employees, is used to recommend different management styles.</li>
            <li>No one management style works in all situations. Just like with communication, you will likely want to vary your approach based on the situation to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Leadership and management are similar, although management implies a specific title. Leadership may be selected in a variety of ways, such as an appointment leader, democratic leader or emergent leader. Some people may be excellent leaders, although they may not have a formal title within an organization.</li>
            <li>Depending on the situation, a leader may take on a variety of roles to solve challenges.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="title">Chapter Case</h3>
        <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel-ch08_s03_p01">You own a  regional gifts store in your town. The store opened in 2009 and the same four people have worked together since that time. Recently, the manager left and you need to hire a new manager. You have decided that one of the four people currently working for you would definitely be great for the job, but you need to create a list of criteria for the job and then compare it with the skills of your existing employees. Your task is to develop specific criteria or a "wish list" of skills and abilities for this job based on three different aspects:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="portolesediashumrel-ch08_s03_l01">
            <li>Skills needed for the job</li>
            <li>Human relations skills</li>
            <li>Leadership skills</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para" id="portolesediashumrel-ch08_s03_p99">Once you have created the criteria, rank the skills in each category and provide a written description as to why you ranked as you did.</p>
